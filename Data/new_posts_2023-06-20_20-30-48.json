I noticed that I was ONLY down 95.7% on my NKLA shares, instead of 98.5% like usual. Now, I YOLO\u2019d into these shares literally years ago, and I sold most of them, but sort of kept a small number as a tombstone. To remember, to try and learn, idk why but they went up for multiple days in a row, and it continued today.\n\nNow, because I\u2019m regarded, I already bought OTM $1.50 calls. I\u2019m gonna buy more, and I don\u2019t care who knows it. I\u2019m gonna buy shares, too, because this is actually a winner. \n\nI know some people don\u2019t believe in the whole hydrogen thing, but try and have some faith, yeah? Yolo into some calls with me. Make it fun for yourselves. Make some money, enough to burn in a fire and stay warm. \n\nRemember the old WSB? The WSB that was cool? Where people made (and lost) real money, but everyone just commented: stonks go up stonks go down you can\u2019t splain that\n\nActual DD:   \n NKLA is partnering with Voltera, who is in turn funded by a Scandinavian investment fund with \\~$25 billion in unallocated funds.

    "selftext": "Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.\n\nIn terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.\n\nIn the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is \"Hold\". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.\n\nConsidering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:\n\n**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.\n\n**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.\n\n**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.\n\n**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.\n\n**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.\n\n**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.\n\n**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.\n\n**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.\n\n**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is \"Hold\", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.\n\nHowever, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.\n\nAn addendum that incorporates some extra key points:\n\n**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.\n\n**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.\n\n**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.\n\n**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.\n\n**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.\n\n**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.\n\nIn summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**27 ROKU shares**\n\n**7 ROKU $69 7/28**\n\n**2 ROKU $80 9/15**\n\nall ROKU positions entered today\n\n**1 NFLX $475 7/21 (cheers on being the only streaming company that cuts leeches)**\n\nCredentials: actual Autism Spectrum Disorder with a hyper fixation on the stock market and using being insanely nerdy about shit to make hella bread.\n\nPast decent trades:\n\nLoaded NVDA shares before earnings because I\u2019m a college student and I study Brain & Cognitive Science, so I just talk about AI/ML/ANN all day.\n\nChegg Puts before earnings (20x+!!) because what a shitty company, Quora for idiots who can\u2019t cheat correctly.

    "title": "FedEx earnings today - What do?",
    "selftext": "Today, FedEx will be reporting Q4 earnings. The Air Freight/Couriers industry operates air transportation and recurring delivery services. This includes companies offering same-day deliveries, scheduled delivery and logistical services. The proliferation of e-commerce/online retail with a growing emphasis on faster delivery has expanded opportunities for this industry, and induced more competition. United Parcel Service, Inc., FedEx Corporation and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. are some of the major companies in this industry. \n\nTheir fiscal year ends in May, which means the coming report covers the end of its fiscal year 2023. The company typically offers financial forecasts as a fiscal year begins, so FedEx\u2019s Tuesday report will offer investors an early look at what the logistics business indicates about how 2024 is shaping up for the global economy. \n\nAnalysts are estimating earnings of $4.85 per share as opposed to earnings of $6.87 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Wall Street is expecting the company to report $22.55 billion, a decrease of 7.60% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts are expecting a profit of $14.80 per share. In the previous year, there was a loss of $20.61 per share. On average, analysts estimate full-year revenue to be $90.88 billion, compared to $ 93.50 billion in the previous year.\n\nLast earnings was good though, in the last earnings report on February 28, FDX exceeded expectations by reporting earnings per share of $3.41. This surpassed the estimated figure of $2.76. This positive surprise highlights the company's ability to outperform market expectations and suggests its strong operational performance.\n\nI expect persistent demand weakness, especially at FedEx Express, to have dented performance in the to-be-reported quarter owing to lower global volumes. Increased purchased transportation rates and lower package volume are likely to have affected the quarterly performance of the FedEx Ground segment. A slowing economy has weighed on FedEx results in recent quarters.\n\nIn April, FedEx announced its [DRIVE initiative](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-announces-planned-consolidation-of-operating-companies) to consolidate its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services and other operating companies into the single Federal Express Corporation under the FedEx brand. FedEx expects DRIVE to generate $4 billion in permanent cost reductions in 2025 after the transition is fully implemented in June 2024.\n\nAn Analyst from [Raymond James](https://www.raymondjames.ca/corporations-and-institutions/equity-capital-markets/equity-research/analyst-profiles) noted that the initiative will drive better margins, earnings and free cash flow in the coming years. The DRIVE transition, focus on trimming costs and capital allocation, along with a shareholder-friendly capital return program should improve returns, the firm wrote. They lowered its price target on FedEx stock to 280 from 285 but maintained the outperform rating on shares.\n\nMeanwhile, [Jefferies](https://www.jefferies.com/ResearchandAnalysis/Equity-Research/2/75) says \"all eyes will be on\" FedEx's fiscal 2024 guidance during results this afternoon. Wall Street could react negatively to an \"overly optimistic\" earnings target from the company, Jefferies wrote in a research note early Tuesday. An EPS guidance \"materially north of $20 would be viewed as a stretch-goal,\" the firm wrote while a \"realistic range\" would be between $15 to $21 per share. Jefferies maintained its 230 price target on FedEx stock and its hold rating on the shares.\n\nI believe a good report will launch the company up over 10% today, but it might not be in the cards. However, while my initial research was bearish but as I looked more into it, I started to believe in calls a bit more. But what does the technical analysis say? There are indications that the stock will move *both* up and down. Very indicative, right? On the bullish side, the MACD for FDX just turned positive on June 9th and we crossed above the 50-day moving average on June 16th. However, on the bearish side, the 10-day RSI Indicator for FDX moved out of overbought territory on June 16. The [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) demonstrated that the ticker has stayed in the overbought zone for 5 days. The longer the ticker stays in the overbought zone, the sooner a price pull-back is expected. In addition, FDX broke above its upper Bollinger Band on June 15th. This could be a sign that the stock is set to drop as the stock moves back below the upper band and toward the middle band. \n\nGuh. I'm going to get a strangle. I'm going to grab a FDX 6/23 240c for 4.55 and the 6/23 222.5p for 3.90. This means I can grab the strangle for $845. It'll be profitable if the stock goes down lower than ~214 (down about 8%) or up higher than ~248 (up about 7%). If it helps, FDX has moved - on average - more than 8% with earnings.",

As part of the agreement, the German government will provide subsidies worth \u20ac10 billion ($10.9 billion) to Intel. The signing ceremony is set to take place between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Intel's CEO, Pat Gelsinger. While Intel shares have already witnessed a 38% increase this year, the company aims to reduce its reliance on Asian chip manufacturing by establishing production facilities in other regions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Initially, Intel had planned to build a plant in Magdeburg, an eastern German city, but due to economic challenges, the project was postponed. The government had previously promised \u20ac6.8 billion in aid for that project. The new package not only includes the substantial subsidy but also introduces price caps on energy. Intel had expressed concerns about high energy costs in Germany, which escalated due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  \n>  \n>In addition to the German facility, Intel also announced plans for a significant chip manufacturing plant in Kiryat Gat, Israel.

    "selftext": "  \nAlright WSB. So I (for research purposes) decided to download Grindr and immediately got like 15x as many matches as I did on Tinder. This made me realize that Grindr is probably making HELLA tendies from these insanely active users.  \nIt turns out I was right, and GRND is set up for insane growth and $$ in the future.\n\nNow I will make this shit short because you all have an attention span shorter than a cocaine crazed monkey. (If you want more information, here's a ton of info I collected about the company[ https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PLrTHYfY3Hz\\_udhv2DrDCgGNqeAkdJk7HbvjLLTUh4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14PLrTHYfY3Hz_udhv2DrDCgGNqeAkdJk7HbvjLLTUh4/edit?usp=sharing)) \\*WARNING, there are no crayon pictures -- so if you can't read don't click the link  \n\n\n**Thesis:**\n\n* Americans are lonelier, hornier, and gayer than ever, and who will benefit from that? Grindr!\n* GRND has a large and growing monetizable user base\n* Solid fundamentals with rapidly increasing Revenue and EBITDA\n* Low IV and Beta\n* 94.8% of shares are not publicly traded\n\nFor those of you who wanna actually \u201cinvest\u201d (or atleast buy Leaps), I\u2019ll give you the long-term play first. For the rest of you who just wanna YOLO on Weeklies, the short-term play is further below.  \n**Long-Term:**\n\nLoneliness rates in America are rising at a rapid pace, with each subsequent generation more lonely than the last\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g13xnibdh67b1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42e7f9e6c8dc0b0313c8a20b0d9a4ed6521a968e\n\nThis is set to continue as technology makes us more disconnected. This sounds sad, but guess what we can do from this? GET FUCKING RICH!\n\nBecause of this, online dating apps are increasing insanely fast. A lot of lonely people (especially redditors), will pay insane amounts of money for the chance to date or have sex.\n\nIn addition to this, younger generations are MUCH more likely to identify as LGBT+\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v1rg9wdh67b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b0f2128356ac9ec4d5c0d9f75a51adee3d392bbf\n\nThis sets up GRND in a PERFECT position. Growing loneliness and growing gayness. And they have capitalized on this, with now over 13 million monthly active users\n\nAnd luckily for Grindr, 90% of their revenue comes from subscriptions. This means any potential economic slowdown won't impact them nearly as much as their competitors who rely more on ads.\n\nIn addition to this, the fundamentals are solid\n\n1. The company has positive FCF and rapidly growing EBITDA meaning GRND likely won\u2019t need to raise more capital\n2. EBITDA is growing MUCH faster than revenue - meaning this company will be a cash flow machine!\n3. Revenue is still growing fast and is projected to continue like that for some time\n4. Their Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is almost 2x as high as their competitors such as Bumble and 1.5x higher than Match Group\n5. Their Cost of Revenue is decreasing over time while their Gross Profit is growing at 35%+\n6. Their assets are growing faster than their liabilities\n\nThese numbers are crazy good, especially considering these are Y/Y numbers that were likely inflated by COVID and lonely people in lockdown with a ton of $$ and time to spend.\n\nNow I spent 10 hours digging deeper into the filings and found a fuck ton of good numbers - but that is kinda boring so if u have questions and wanna see info just comment or go to the google doc pasted above.\n\nFor those with gambling addictions, here is the short term play  \n\n\n**Short Term:**\n\nGRND\u2019s public float is ONLY 5.2% of outstanding shares, with the rest being held by insiders and institutions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygz92g2fh67b1.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aac39ff59d81e4722477c0ab4878e218f4055cf4\n\nWhat this means is any buying pressure has a MASSIVE impact on share prices. Like I am talking about a bigger impact than when your wife\u2019s boyfriend pounds her.\n\nIn addition, 72.5% of the shares CAN\u2019T even be sold!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j3f2pdmfh67b1.png?width=1437&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5695fcd1fb37fb8d02b6718cf1e1537bfec4350e\n\nWhat makes this play EVEN better is the fact that GRND has a Beta of 0.13 (basically 9x less volatile than the s&p). You might be thinking \u201cBORING\u201d, but you are wrong. Options are now incredibly cheap!\n\nThis is essentially the best time in history to buy call options cause of the low IV. Basically with any positive news or catalyst, this stock is set to EXPLODE.\n\nPositions: 400 shares & 3 7/21 $5 C\n\nTLDR:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7lbeeqkgh67b1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=641c3b618f5e3bccfc92a5918a669169156d92f6",

    "selftext": "Let's talk about the incessant recession headlines that have been dominating the news lately. Initially centered on the United States, the focus has now shifted to a so-called \"worldwide\" recession. However, it's crucial to question the prevailing narrative and critically analyze the situation. While high interest rates in the US and globally may raise concerns, the news often presents a different story. Let's break free from the moneyed Wall Street trap and explore the reality.\n\nIntel's Strategic Investments: A Positive Outlook\n\nContrary to the recession narrative, Intel is actively investing billions worldwide to address the challenges in Chinese supply chains. This shows a long-term commitment to solving the issues rather than a harbinger of economic downturn.\n\nIndia's Record Order: A Sign of Economic Strength\n\nThe Paris Airshow witnessed India's historic order of 500 airplanes just this morning, hinting at a robust economic outlook. Notably, India's significance in this context cannot be overlooked, suggesting potential growth opportunities outside of China.\n\nChallenging the Perception:My theory diverges from the prevailing belief that a recession is imminent. I argue that perceived shocks and market drops are often linked to those who deliberately choose to ignore the economic situations in Western Europe and the USA, which stand in contrast to a challenging environment in China. China's youth unemployment rate and the need for additional stimulus amid an already heated economic climate provide evidence of this. Moreover, concerns about China's real estate bubble raise more than just eyebrows for the informed investor.\n\nInvestment Strategies:Given the current market climate, it becomes crucial to identify companies that are not trading at all-time highs but possess significant growth potential. You do not want to buy VOO at ATH or the mega cap tech stocks at ATH.\n\nOne example of what is investable is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), which remains undervalued despite its long-term prospects. While TSMC's US factory investment is noteworthy, the key play lies in the belief that China is unlikely to invade Taiwan in the next two decades. This perspective aligns with the global will, barring any extreme actions by Xi Jinping resembling Mao's regime. If you are not aware, believe me when I say that the Xi is aware that a dozen well placed ships could block all middle eastern oil shipments from reaching China, destroying the economy, even if they could blockade Tawain. Berkshire Hathaway would potentially invest billions in TSMC if it were not entangled in Chinese interests, highlighting the company's strong position. Intel is another strong example.\n\nWhile the prevailing narrative warns of a looming recession, it is essential to challenge these assumptions and examine the global economic landscape more objectively. By identifying undervalued companies with significant growth potential, such as TSMC, long-term investors can seek opportunities in the market. Depending on reception of my write up, I'll share other investment ideas if there's interest as I have identified several.\n\nTL:DR Wall Street has way too much money in China, they need to offload it to under-informed investors in an enviroment like this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Made post a bit clearer",

This bear parade has dropped around 30% from its peak. Multiple downgrades, many institutions hating on them. The recent short is at 11%, a highly bearish mentality over angry boomers. \n\n**So why am I bring them up now?**\n\nTarget is oversold on the agenda of \"decreasing consumer discretionary spending\" and \"protests\". These are nothing but an over-hyped bear's wet dream. For example, research is pointing towards a significant increase of foot traffic into Target. Consumer Spending is increasing despite the doomer posts.  \n\nThe downgrades reasoning seemed fishy that pointed at $WMT taking more of the sector. I would argue that $TGT target audiences are different from $WMT. $TGT's audience is Millennials/College Student who want a \"luxury\" experience that cannot afford it. These two audiences with large student debts may sound scary but will not hurt $TGT's bottom line as long as political garbage drags the issue.   \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n$TGT dropping as hard as they did while other discretionary consumer retailer/company is at/near 52w Highs seems contradictory. Either the entire market is ignoring $TGT (Consumer Spending is increasing) or the market is overpricing everyone else (Consumer Spending is decreasing yet they're expecting to buy $AAPL's $3.5k porn gear?). \n\n**Positions**\n\n\\- Currently debit spreads: 10x each Sept 145/155C & 155/165C\n\n\\- Goal: 50x Sept 145C & 155C and 200x 14DTE w/ +15% movement on earnings.",

This resulted in Credit Suisse losing money over the last two years. \nBut unlike Silicon Valley Bank which made some mad bet on interest rates and was essentially bankrupt, Credit Suisse still had a solid balance sheet and a valuable core business franchise.\nThe general view is that UBS was forced into the acquisition with no other player being interested at all. That wasn\u2019t the case though. As revealed later on by Swiss media, Blackrock was interested as a potential bidder for CS. (1) In 2009 they acquired Barclays\u2019s investment arm in 2009 for $15.2 billion which made it into the world\u2019s biggest asset manager. The Swiss government wanted a local solution though. And so it came that **UBS was \u201cforced\u201d to dictate deal terms that Credit Suisse and the Swiss government couldn\u2019t refuse.**\n\n**Here the main deal facts (2):**\n- Ubs paid $3.5 bln to acquire Credit Suisse with net tangible assets of $48.8 bln \n- Loss protection guarantee of $10 bln by the Swiss government for UBS for any loss above $5.5bln arising from potentially problematic assets that UBS takes over from the CS acquisition.\n- $110 billion in liquidity assistance to UBS by the Swiss National Bank\n- Credit Suisse AT 1 obligations of 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) were written down completely as part of transaction.\n\n**UBS is set for a one-time gain of 5 times its yearly net profits:**\nUBS paid $3.5 bln to acquire $48.8 bln of Credit Suisse net tangible assets. Per their SEC filing UBS is set to declare an additional one-time gain of 34.8 bln USD in their second (upcoming) quarter. (3) **This with $10.6 bln of Credit Suisse assets already written down as value corrections by UBS.** Keep in mind that this is likely a *conservative estimate by UBS as it\u2019s in their interest to overstate the risks of Credit Suisse takeover not to worsen Swiss politics sentiment* about the deal and to build up the narrative of a new CEO who starts with a difficult situation and then turns it into a great success.\n\n**Long-term synergies with a restructuring process guaranteed by Swiss government:**\nUBS acquired a lot of assets for an extremely low price. But in order to profit off this acquisition, UBS has to succeed in the restructuring process Credit Suisse failed for so long. This will likely not be without initial losses. Keep in mind though that significant losses will be covered by the Swiss government with the loss guarantee of $10 bln. \nWhile UBS will drive down the risky investment banking of Credit Suisse their wealth management divisions complement each other well where Credit Suisse had traditionally a strong presence in SEA and Latin America where UBS was weak. The fusion of Credit Suisse and UBS will lead to significant cost savings from the resulting synergies. While integration is usually not easy for banks, UBS and Credit Suisse literally have their Headquarters on the same street facing each other. \nUBS also acquired the pearl of Credit Suisse, it\u2019s Swiss division that alone consistently makes more than $1bln annual net profit which UBS could either IPO for an estimated $15bln (already five times more than the total acquisition of CS) or keep for an even stronger position in Switzerland. (4)\n\n**Unbiased Experts see it as great deal:**\nIn a survey of Swiss economists (unbiased) approximately three quarters of the surveyed economic researchers view the takeover as a great deal for UBS. (5) \n\n**Management is competent:**\nWhereas Credit Suisse management was infamous for its incompetency, the new UBS will be led by no other than the former UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti who in the past already successfully winded down the investment bank of UBS and turned it into the successful bank it is today. A task he now has to repeat for the integrated Credit Suisse.\n\n**Bank is secured by Swiss National Bank:**\nUBS was provided by the Swiss National Bank $108 bln of liquidity needed to weather any potential future bank crisis. It\u2019s way too big to fail for Switzerland now so it\u2019s one of the most secure banks in the world.\n\n**Credit Suisse outflows already stopped:**\nCredit Suisse was suffering from the outflows of their customers due to uncertainty. With the acquisition of UBS these outflows have already stopped completely. (6)\n\n**Deal is priced in as a negative for UBS:**\nThe current UBS stock price at $20.40 is lower than before the acquisition. \n\n**Tldr:**\nUBS is set to make a one-time gain of 34.8 bln USD (5 times their net profit of 2022) in upcoming quarter. Long-term UBS will profit from synergies while the Swiss government guaranteeing any potential significant losses from the restructuring process. Management is competent. The market weirdly thinks the acquisition of Credit Suisse was a net negative for UBS as the current stock price of UBS is lower than before the acquisition. \n\n\nThis is no financial advice. As usual do your own research.\n\n\n**Sources:**\n(1) https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/how-the-swiss--trinity--forced-ubs-to-save-credit-suisse/48378088\n\n(2) https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bloomberg/ubs-to-buy-credit-suisse-in--3.3-billion-deal-to-end-crisis/48373632\n\n(3) https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-ubs-estimates-348-bln-of-negative-idUSFWN37D21I\n\n(4) https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/de/research-berichte/finanzberichte-tochtergesellschaften/credit-suisse-schweiz-ag.html\n\n(5) https://kof.ethz.ch/news-und-veranstaltungen/medien/medienmitteilungen/2023/03/kof-nzz-umfrage-unter-oekonominnen-und-oekonomen-wirtschaftsforschende-bewerten-die-uebernahme-der-credit-suisse-durch-die-ubs-skeptisch.html\n\n(6) https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ubs-ceo-ermotti-credit-suisse-no-longer-seeing-outflows-situation-has-stabilised-2023-05-12/\n\n(7) https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-ceo-memo-signals-ubs-deal-close-monday-bloomberg-2023-06-10/",

Previous phase 2 clinical trial results were very promising and with the announcement of successful phase 3 results the stock is poised to 2x or 3x in value from its current price of $16.72. Call and Put IV is extraordinarily high currently and therefore I believe the best way to play this is by selling puts.\n\n\n\nRESEARCH\n\nPHASE 2 (PRAISE) RESULTS.\n\nTrial results showed that pamrevlumab reduced the decline in lung function, the primary efficacy outcome measure. Patients receiving pamrevlumab experienced a less sharp worsening in predicted FVC compared with the placebo group \u2014 a mean change of less 2.9% versus less 7.2% in the placebo group.\n\nThis translated into a 60.3% relative reduction in predicted FVC decline in participants treated with pamrevlumab at week 48.\n\nThe treatment also was associated with a halt in disease progression. At week 48, 10% of the participants in the pamrevlumab group and 31.4% in the placebo group had experienced disease progression, defined as a decline in percentage of predicted FVC of 10% or more, or death.\n\nOther positive findings were seen for secondary efficacy outcomes, including lung function. For the first time, positive findings also were seen in quality of life, and chest imaging through a quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).\n\nRegarding safety, pamrevlumab was found to be well-tolerated, with a safety profile similar to the placebo.\n\nSource:\nhttps://pulmonaryfibrosisnews.com/news/pamrevlumab-efficacy-safety-ipf-supported-by-final-praise-trial-data/\n\n\nJOB LISTING\n\nRecent job listings indicate the company is preparing for the success of its clinical trial. Thane Wettig, Chief Commercial Officer at FibroGen commented on a job listing reposted 2 weeks ago for job title Sr. Director, Pamrevlumab Insights:\n\n\u201cWe are re-starting the search for our Insights Leader in advance of our upcoming pamrevlumab Phase 3 data read-outs. If you have experience leading Insights work for a biopharma brand in the pre-launch / launch phase, take a look at the JD and apply! You will be joining a highly talented and experienced commercial team at a critical time for FibroGen.\u201d\n\nA biopharmaceutical company may want to hire an Insights Leader or Insights Professional before announcing topline results of a clinical trial of one of its drugs for several reasons. One possible reason is to prepare for the potential launch of the drug by understanding the market landscape, customer needs and preferences, competitive positioning, pricing and reimbursement strategies, and value proposition.\n\nSource:\nhttps://fibrogen.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/FibroGen/job/San-Francisco-CA/Sr-Director--Pamrevlumab-Insights_2022289-1?source=Linkedin\n\n\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTS\n\nComments made by management at the 44th annual global healthcare conference on June 12th indicate that the company expects success for its clinical trial:\n\n\u201cManagement noted that they believe that pamrevlumab could expand the treatment rate in IPF due to the poor tolerability of approved treatments given a replication of the Phase 2 PRAISE data. Further, regarding the topline readout, management expects to provide data on the primary and secondary endpoints, as well as safety data. Finally, management thinks that ZEPHYRUS-1 and PRAISE would be enough to engage the FDA for regulatory filing, and would not necessarily wait for ZEPHYRUS-2.\u201d\n\n\nANALYST PRICE TARGETS\n\nNotably bearish Goldman Sachs on June 14 reaffirmed its Sell rating but with a $16 price target, stating:\n\n\u201cWhile the -049 and PRAISE data provide support for ZEPHYRUS-1 to succeed, multiple nuances still warrant some caution, in our view (see our full preview note HERE). Assuming positive data, management believes PRAISE and ZEPHYRUS-1 could support a filing to make pamrevlumab the first novel IPF therapy approved in nearly a decade.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, on June 12 Stifel upgraded its outlook from Hold to Buy and raised its price target to $28 from $23, stating:\n\n\"A positive outcome for pamrevlumab could be meaningful beyond any one program\u2019s value contribution, specifically presenting the opportunity to reestablish credibility,\" wrote Stifel analysts. \"Trial success would push the stock to multiples of its current level.\"\n\n\n\nTIMING\n\nThe company last formally stated that Zephyrus-1 results are to be released mid-2023, with no exact date provided, however:\n\nIn response to an inquiry on June 26 about timing of the topline results for the ZEPHYRUS-1 clinical trial, Michael Tung, M.D.. Corporate Strategy / Investor Relations at Fibrogen, said: \u201cLatest guidance is in a \u2018few weeks\u2019\u201d.\n\nIf you calculate the days it took to release top-line results for Lelantos-1 phase 3 from its primary end date, and apply it to the primary end date for ZEPHYRUS-1, you get July 14. Calculated mid-point of year is July 1.\n\nTherefore, given recent company commentary, option premiums, and my own calculations, I believe topline results will be announced sometime between July 1 and July 14.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI believe $FGEN (Fibrogen) topline results for the phase 3 clinical trial of its pamrevlumab drug targeting IPF will be announced sometime between July 1 and July 14. Given previous phase 2 clinical trial results, recent job listings, recent comments by management at a global health conference, and recent Analyst comments and upgrades, I believe the results of its phase 3 clinical trial will be positive and the announcement as such will cause the stock to rise 2x or 3x from its current price of $16.72. Given the extremely high options premiums (35%+ yield to strike) and high put IV, I believe the best way to play this is by selling July or August OTM puts.",

    "selftext": "Throughout the years of surfing WallStreetBets some of the worst loss porn i've ever seen has to be people on margin accounts, basically where traders get at least 2X of the money they deposited loaned to them, which theoretically can work out if your correct, but more often than not if a trade goes against you (more so in options) then you end up owing the brokerage money on top of the money you already lost from your initial deposit (also known as a deficit), but i do have a few tips so you don't screw yourself over:\n\n* If you can't or don't want to switch from a margin account, then have some self-discipline by only using the balance you deposited & made money on\n* If your using robinhood then you can disable margin: Account -> Menu -> Investing -> Disable margin investing (note: by disabling margin you still have access to features such as instant bank deposits & instant settlement)\n* If on any other brokerage then i recommend switching to a cash account\n\nPersonally i've been trading the markets for 5 years and never once ran into this issue because very early on i was taught to only risk money i can afford to lose.",

Cash flow is small but unilaterally directed long.\n* The huge spike in price required sustained cash inflows of 10-30x regular volume. Say you bought shares at $20. Who is buying them from you at $120 at 5x the price? The market is a zero sum game. That money has to come from somewhere.\n* Monthly Cash Flow went negative for the back half of the top.

I'm finding it hard to disagree.\n\nThe only way they can go tits up is a huge general market crash in the week or so between buying and selling, or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan (which would kill TSM but actually moon INTC).

I didn\u2019t post this when it was happening because I didn\u2019t wanna jinx it. $95k was the highest day. Everyone told me to cash out on this day, but I thought I would keep earning. I was wrong. But I still made 47K profit, so not a bad month. \n\nWish I would\u2019ve also bought Target puts. \n\nSince cashing out of bud, I\u2019m at $32 K on a $10 k Intel call option. And up $4k on an EVGO call. \n\nA TD Ameritrade rep told me that for one of my $BUD calls, I was the only person who bought that call. And for another call, I owned more than half of the contracts at that strike price. I found it surprising that after seeing the gravity of the boycott, with shelves full of bud light, more people hadn\u2019t predicted the seemingly imminent dip. The stock is literally named after the beer.\n\nDuring the frenzy on regional banks, I didn\u2019t want to miss out, so I made a snap bet that the banks would recover. I was wrong, and it cost me. Now I try to avoid making snap decisions. It seems pretty easy to make money on options if you are patient and wait for the right opportunity.",

    "selftext": "I'm a technical trader. Before that turns you off, and the images of charts make your brain melt, just HEAR ME THE FUCK OUT. This chart setup for $OPEN is perfect. When I see something like this, I immediately know that it's a \"go all in\" moment. It's practically my only strategy for trading, and I'm often stuck scanning for months to find it in action. These setups do NOT happen often, they can take months/years to form, and you can expect it maybe once in the lifetime of a stock.\n\n**$OPEN is set to go to 4.22, with the upside of 5.77,** and the moon being 8.66. Thats 40%, 88%, and 184%. Do the math on what the nets you in options. These moves happen within 40 days-ish, with the potential to happen in 7.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qyozascgvg6b1.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa6bd310c175519a7e45f28be32e91bed2276e8f\n\nI didn't pull these price targets out of my ass. They come from a 360Day/4Hr chart with standard deviation levels on it. When you look at the photos of the chart, that's what the Green, Orange, and Red lines are. Everybody can google what a horizontal range break looks like, but once I started cross referencing with the deviation levels, this setup became practically the only thing I trade. They're an absolute game changer. Fuck all of the other chart studies, moving average lines, RSI, volume. **When a stock breaks a longtime horizontal consolidation zone, and is simultaneously crossing a downtrending \\[green\\] line, there is almost always major price action to the upside**. I typically see a move to the dashed deviation line, some resistance, and then a move to the next full deviation line, some resistance, and etc.\n\nThe fact that $OPEN is breaking resistance & the Green line at the same time is what makes the setup absolutely golden. **Just look at what happened with $SOXL and tell me the setup doesn't look the same.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhy9lchfwg6b1.png?width=2818&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5da3dd951ca96e6b6752da7bf7fb7e7102b4fbca\n\n **Just look at what happened with $CCL and tell me the setup doesn't look the same.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2c7l6e23wg6b1.png?width=2810&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6097862a8310e578dbcd03aad6bb2a5ced0ec7f8\n\n\"Yeah sure, the charts all look the same. So what. Doesn't mean $OPEN will follow. Also, the stocks been downtrending for a reason, and they haven't even been in the news lately\".\n\nI'm not here to say OPEN is a good company. Who cares. This strategy requires beat up stocks that are showing signs of life at a very cheap price. A move from 3 to 5 will go unnoticed, and it might even continue downtrending for years after that, **but we'll already cash out by then.** When the expectations are so low for a company like OPEN, sentiment \"can only go up\". This happens all of the time for shitty stocks, but I can't explain when those moves will happen. With OPEN, I believe I can. With OPEN, I have a VERY good idea of what it will do, and I've just supplied the supporting evidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExtra:\n\nWhen I was playing SOXL, the microchip index, I didn't know why it would break, just that it was getting read to. Then BOOM, NVDA absolutely rips, sending SOXL rocketing too. Sometimes the charts predict the news.\n\nWe saw something similar with $SOFI, but Sofi had a larger consolidation range, making the move on the break less, percentage wise. Another example is $CCL (included), but again, $OPEN looks better.\n\nPeople might not be impressed with 40% price action, but \"just trust me bro\", when I see this setup, it gets my d\\*\\*\\* hard. I've tried so many times to tell others of this strategy, and I've finally decided to take it to WSB. Why is it that this always works, somebody tell me.\n\nTLDR: Look at effin photos.",

    "selftext": "# Market Momentum Stalls Amid Volatility: Tech Giants Apple and Microsoft Slip from Highs\n\nWall Street's relentless AI-driven surge paused this past Friday as a colossal options expiration event put the market to the test. Underperforming relative to major benchmarks, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 saw losses driven by Microsoft and Apple, recently reaching record closing highs. Meanwhile, Micron Technology's bleak warning dealt a blow to chipmakers, even as Adobe ascended on a hopeful forecast. Despite breaking its six-day winning streak, the S&P 500 concluded its best week since March.\n\nThis week posed a unique challenge to traders, torn between participating in this year's rally and anxiety over an overheated market. A new concern emerged: the need for strategic positioning.\n\nAround $4.2 trillion in options contracts linked to stocks and indexes were slated to expire, necessitating that traders either roll over current positions or initiate new ones. The effect of these derivatives on trading was significant enough to see the market's preferred volatility measure - the VIX - rise along with the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, the VIX succumbed to pressure by week's end, erasing its weekly gains with Friday's tumble.\n\n#### Bulls couldn\u2019t reclaim the M15 bearish order block at 442.57 - 442.40\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3dud691gvg6b1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=483278e135acc91fc049df5df7c0e6065297d531\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbcx3ixgvg6b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=65198c08b0d06b5f22ebd244994e887328355cf6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y5w387whvg6b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d24c580f99389032d7a8e00cef73dc0d8ff21daa\n\nI took two trades today on ES.

At 8:30 am ET, the announcement of housing starts for May will command attention, following last month's report of 1.40 million starts. Further on, at 11:45 am, we anticipate insights from New York Fed President John Williams, whose speech will draw considerable interest from market watchers.\n\n# COT Data - E-MINI S&P 500\n\nBetween June 6 and June 16, 2023, the Commitments of Traders (COT) report for E-MINI S&P 500 futures denotes an array of trading activities across all categories:\n\nDealer Intermediaries:\n\n* Long positions witnessed a reduction, declining by 40,536 to 525,580.\n* However, short positions experienced an upsurge, increasing by 48,992 to 534,204.\n\nThis suggests a shift towards a bearish sentiment, with short positions showing a larger increase.\n\nAsset Managers/Institutional Investors:\n\n* Long positions saw an escalation, rising by 46,652 to a significant 1,096,444.\n* Short positions saw a decrease, dropping by 50,841 to 332,825.\n\nThis suggests a strong bullish sentiment, with an increase in long positions and a decrease in short positions.\n\nLeveraged Funds:\n\n* Long positions decreased, falling by 8,787 to 173,084.\n* Short positions also saw a decrease, dropping by 46,353 to 711,649.\n\nThe larger decrease in short positions indicates a shift towards a bullish sentiment, despite the decrease in long positions.\n\nIn conclusion, the \"smart money\" groups (Dealer Intermediaries and Asset Managers/Institutional investors) demonstrate a mix of sentiments - bullish for Asset Managers/Institutional investors and bearish for Dealer Intermediaries. On the other hand, Leveraged Funds indicate a bullish sentiment for E-MINI S&P 500 futures\u200b[**1**](https://www.tradingster.com/cot/futures/fin/13874A)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pb6qkbpvg6b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8b6e4e51d426817b9fab6d9a3cbb364d7832dcea\n\n# SPY Technical Outlook\n\n#### TLDR\n\nOn the daily chart, the bias is bullish, expecting a pullback to the 434.63 - 431.99 FVG and possibly the 431.99 - 428.87 bullish order block this week. The H1 chart reflects a bearish bias, with the market dipping below 440.12 market structure shift. Selling opportunities emerge within the H1 and M5 order blocks at 442.38 - 440.97 and 442.38 - 442.01, respectively. Aiming for the H1 bullish order block at 436.27 - 435.62 could prove beneficial. Moreover, there's a noteworthy H1 imbalance between 438.37 - 435.91.\n\n#### Daily Chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kgqb8hdrvg6b1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=53fb15e138356480cef04f022aeab86d28444363\n\nBias: Bullish\n\nLooking for a pullback at the current level this week to the 434.63 - 431.99 FVG and potentially the 431.99 - 428.87 bullish order block. Knockout prior days high, and we will have to adjust the daily range.\n\nDealing Range:\n\n* 0%: 443.90\n* 50%: 430.06\n* 100%: 416.22\n\nPDH/PDL\n\n* 443.61\n* 438.97\n\nBullish Blocks:\n\n* 431.99 - 428.87\n* 419.22 - 416.22\n\nBullish FVGs:\n\n* 434.63 - 431.99\n* 426.36 - 419.22\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yiez7mjtvg6b1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2ebd34cc9e6891ed97ecfcec10230c1653de6ae5\n\nH1 Chart\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d18ldhjxvg6b1.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b48aa8f3b30e6a4abfae2b648fe4524e7801d6de\n\nBias: Bearish\n\nToday, the market experienced a shift and fell below 440.12. I\u2019m looking for selling opportunities at the H1 order block between 442.38 - 440.97. Alternatively, the M5 order block at 442.38 - 442.01 could also be a good option to sell, with a target of the h1 bullish order block at 436.27 - 435.62.

The cyclical pattern follows the biological nature of beef cattle production and cattle producers\u2019 responses to changes in prices and climate conditions.\n\nThe current cattle cycle, which began in 2014, is now in a contraction phase, with inventory contracting at an increasing rate each year since 2020.\"\n\n\n[MORE BEEFY DETAILS](https://lcmspubcontact.lc.ca.gov/PublicLCMS/templates/AD59_06162023_meat_prices1.htm)",

In other news, the Department of Justice has notified the PGA Tour that it plans to review the golf organization's proposed merger with Saudi-backed LIV Golf over antitrust concerns. The deal has drawn criticism from lawmakers and human rights activists, and the DOJ's review could delay or even derail the merger. Finally, Mediterranean fast-casual chain Cava soared 99% in its debut on the public markets Thursday.

    "title": "$HOOD - A New Bull Market Beneficary",
    "selftext": " Hello everyone,\n\nIt's been quite some time since I wrote a DD on WSB so I thought I would share this one. Now, I know it's controversial--Robinhood--but making money isn't controversial and I personally believe there's a lot of money to be made on Robinhood's stock as we enter a new bull market. I wrote this DD a few days ago, the price has moved a little higher since. Some pictures are missing because VisualMod won't allow some of the content from Robinhood's roadmap.\n\nState of the Stock\n\nRobinhood\u2019s time in the stock market has been an arduous one and not one without controversy. The stock went public in a hotly anticipated IPO at about $36.41 on July 29th, 2021. It saw tremendous interest in the first week of trading reaching an overly lofty value at \\~$85 a share before starting to sell off. This sell off has relentlessly continued and in many places, you will find negative commentary on the stock.\n\nI personally believe that the stock\u2019s price action bottomed on June 17th, 2022 at about $6.84 a share. Since then the stock has been slowly plodding along and striking higher lows, which I will illustrate later in the charting.\n\nI also believe that the stock\u2019s story is close to turning around and could get more positive attention in the later half of this year. I am going to talk about the balance sheet, cost cutting, charts, and the controversy.\n\nI will be limiting my comments on the balance sheet to lines that I believe deserve notice. For this post, I will be comparing Robinhood to their old school rival, Charles Schwab.\n\nThe Balance Sheet\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c8fg6s92v96b1.jpg?width=2152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce0fe0c434b509162b2c24391c34b6dccf4413e4\n\n$HOOD - Balance Sheet\n\nOverall, I read Robinhood\u2019s balance sheet as being quite strong. Particularly in the amount of cash and sort term investments that the company is carrying. At 5.46 Billion in cash and 1.52 Billion in short term investments the company can cover operating expenses (excl. COGS) for about 3.5 years.\n\nThe company has also shared that the short term investments are in <1 year term treasuries. Which is quite a good decision given the current rates. I only wish they had purchased a little more than 500 million or so.\n\nAs of this writing (6-11-23, 6-15-23 WSB), Robinhood carries a market cap of \\~$8.5 billion as well. Their cash position is nearly the size of their entire equity. In comparison, $SCHW (Charles Schwab) has about $75 billion in cash and a market cap of 100 Billion. I believe that the market is underestimating how Robinhood can deploy that cash.\n\nLastly, Robinhood is very close (9.41 market) to their book value per share (7.83). In comparison, $SCHW has a book value per share of 15.36 and is trading at 55.0 in the market. I believe this illustrates that Robinhood is quite cheap, even after the June \u201922 bounce when it was cheaper than the book.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6q341be3v96b1.jpg?width=1864&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5f34eab839b9cdd86e4cb3da66b5f820f25f3022\n\n$HOOD - FCF\n\nNext, the cashflow at Robinhood is quite good and turned positive in Q4\u201922. Whereas their rivals are experiencing negative free cash flow during this same period. Robinhood, on a relative basis for this metric, looks to be outperforming during the banking crisis.\n\nDuring their earnings calls they have also reported a net increase in deposits as well as assets under custody (AUC) increasing by an impressive 26% due to the run on stocks in 2023.\n\n(Omitted because of Visual Mod)\n\n$HOOD - AUC\n\nWhat I find most interesting about this is that customer cash in Robinhood has steadily grown to $11 billion from $2 billion at IPO. It has been on an impressive path of growth. I believe this is the result of their strong \u201cBrokerage Cash Sweep\u201d program and the rates they\u2019ve been able to offer.\n\nThey have been able to effectively remove the friction between treasury yield and their customers. This also creates a beneficial situation where their clients can deploy capital quickly, while maintaining some yield from their cash. Effectively, creating productive reserves for their customers who can choose to deploy it at any moment right on their app.\n\nIt should be noted that since the may operating data was released AUC has grown another $4.4 billion in deposits to $81.8 Billion. (See $HOOD's operating data release for May)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ejaeub5v96b1.jpg?width=1891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=407d264f4899b1066cfeb9184e513adc80d9f723\n\n$HOOD - Profitability\n\nLastly, the company itself is quite close to profitability. The next 4 quarters are projected by broader WallStreet to come in at an EPS of about -0.01 to -0.03. Any positive change in their costs or earnings could lead to a surprise profit. Such as cash from treasury yield, cost cutting measures, new products, or increased business. The company itself continues to stress, that they are becoming leaner as time goes on. I believe that to be true.\n\nCutting Costs \u2013 The Layoffs\n\nIn 2022, Robinhood performed several rounds of lay offs. This allowed them to cut Q2 \u201922 and Q3 \u201922 operating expenses significantly (excl. COGS). This does not appear to have impacted their revenue growth and has given them the added benefit of being \u2018right sized\u2019. And to the best of my knowledge, no further lay offs are currently on the table. In fact, their revenue is now higher than it has ever been since IPO at $447 million and is pushing them ever closer to profitability.\n\n>\u201cRobinhood Is Laying Off 9% of Its Full-Time Employees\u201d  \n\u2013 Wall Street Journal, Apr. 29, 2022  \n\u201cRobinhood Lays Off 23% of Staff as Retail Investors Fade From Platform\u201d  \n\u2013 Wall Street Journal, Aug. 2, 2022\n\n2023 Road Map \u2013 4 Catalysts\n\n(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)\n\n$HOOD - 2023 Roadmap\n\n(Picture omitted because VisualMod keeps deleting the post. You can find it in their earnings report materials.)\n\n$HOOD - 2023 roadmap cont.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve talked about cost cutting, let\u2019s take a look at the road map and see if there are opportunities for fundamental growth. I will list out 4 that I believe can have a positive impact on their business.\n\n* Options Trading in Cash Accounts\n* Margin Outside Gold\n* Futures Trading\n* UK Market Expansion\n\nLets tackle the first two on the list.\n\nOptions Trading in Cash Accounts should continue to grow their existing business. This should increase their revenue generated per user as more current customers have access to more products. Options trading is particularly popular among Robinhood\u2019s customer demographic.\n\nMargin Outside Gold I find personally controversial. I personally don\u2019t believe in using margin. Regardless, it should also increase their revenue generated per user.\n\nWhile both of these are improvements that could turn the company profitable for EPS. They are not as major as the next two items.\n\nFutures trading would open an entire new market for the Robinhood user. I believe it is an incredibley potent catalyst for their user base and will allow their customers to trade more often and in new ways.\n\n>Robinhood advancing offerings for active traders  \nIn March, we applied for a Futures Commission Merchant license and, if approved on a typical timeline, we  \nexpect to launch futures trading by the end of 2023.\n\nUK Market Expansion should allow them to acquire a significant number of new users.\n\n>Robinhood continues to explore growth opportunities, expands access globally  \nWith an experienced team leading and an existing license in place, we believe we\u2019re on track for our  \nambitious goal of launching brokerage services in the UK by the end of the year.\n\nTo summarize, I believe expanding into a new country, the UK, and providing futures trading to their existing customers they expand their business significantly over time.\n\nLets take a look now at the charts and see what we can find in the price action.\n\nCharting A Path\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bicwds7v96b1.jpg?width=3657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e43f8865553f0b084e90f4ccda1037695f21d236\n\n$HOOD - Price Action 6-11-23, 1D\n\nThe first thing of note on Robinhood\u2019s stock chart is that a series of higher lows have been put in. The price action, for the first time since IPO, is showing an increasing pattern in the price. I believe the stock has a classic Falling Wedge which I interpret as bullish. I believe the wedge has formed because of the positive developments in the balance sheet, cost cutting, and the future outlook.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erv0vkq8v96b1.jpg?width=3685&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=cf2f4868438765f62a9918afbf1bb099731801a7\n\n$HOOD - MACD, 1D\n\nExamining the MACD on the 1D time scale we also see higher lows put in as well as an MACD crossover onto the positive scale. Overall, I read the charts as having increasingly positive momentum. I also believe that momentum is growing, albeit slowly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/64yu4wb9v96b1.jpg?width=3675&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a2acf46864c3b116cce6793fc0c9ac9ff8d6c1fe\n\n$HOOD - DMI, 2D\n\nLastly, on the 2D time scale my favorite indicator, DMI, shows the bulls having taken control on \\~May 24 2023. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any coincidence that was the low after the most recent earnings report. I believe the majority of the bears have left the stock as evident by their strength at \\~11.5. We also have seen the natural termination of the ADX which implies, to me, that the previous trading trend for the stock has come to an end. A new trend does appear to be forming. It could fizzle out, but that\u2019s up to Robinhood\u2019s management.\n\nI believe all of the necessary setups are currently there for them to succeed as both a company and a stock.\n\nClosing Thoughts & Possible RisksThe Demographic & The Controversy\n\nI don't think I have to mention the controversy much here so I am re-writing this section for this post. Regardless...\n\nI believe the controversay for $HOOD regarding GameStop is sorely misplaced and the majority of which is not real. When people 'poo-poo' robinhood I believe that they still use the app. Most of the posts still on this subreddit use it and the proof is in the data, Robinhood is continuing to grow assets under custody and trading volumes.\n\n$HOOD - Monthly Active users\n\n(Omitted because of visualmod)\n\n$HOOD - net funded accounts\n\n(Omitted because of visualmod)\n\nThis could also be related to the flurry of trading activity seen in stocks related to AI in the past few months.\n\nHeavy Insider Selling\n\nAn additional risk is that the insiders, specifically Tenev Vladimir, CEO & Bhatt Baiju, Chief Creative Officer, continue to sell large numbers of shares. This is creating an immense downward pressure on the stock price. If this pattern continues, it could contribute negatively to the stocks performance.\n\nHowever, I believe that\u2019s a non-issue if the company becomes profitable. I hope that we are approaching the end of the insider selling.\n\nCrypto & SEC Action\n\nAdditionally, due to recent events, Robinhood has pulled 3 of their crypto offerings. I believe this is another mixed risk. While they will take a revenue hit by delisting those tokens, they may end up gaining users if customers of Coinbase or Binance decide to take their business elsewhere. **It could end up being beneficial to Robinhood, but there\u2019s no way of knowing at this time.**\n\nAt the time of this writing there has been no report that I can find of Robinhood receiving a notice on the matters affecting Binance and Coinbase. Robinhood instead chose to remove the 3 affected securities voluntarily.\n\nI believe this is the responsible thing to do and well advised. By taking pre-emptive action they are protecting their business from getting entangled in the matter and remaining compliant with the SEC. This is a value the company has stated a number of times during their earnings calls. I believe their actions demonstrate that value and is representative of good governance from the company leadership.\n\nThat said, the SEC could still take action against the company if they choose to do so. Therefore, it still carries some risk and must be considered.\n\nMacro & Last Thoughts\n\nSo, here we are. It\u2019s June 11th, 2023. Costs are significantly reduced and being controlled, notable Roadmap 2023 objectives are close, plans for new markets and offerings are approaching, and revenue continues to grow. The company is just a few pennies away on EPS from breaking even or potentially turning a profit. There is also significant distance from the drama surrounding GameStop, Robinhood, and WallStreetBets.\n\nThe charts are showing higher lows being put in place. More positive momentum looks to be coming into the stock via the MACD. Additionally, the bulls appear to have taken control via the DMI on \\~May 24th, 2023.\n\nI believe this is a case where a significant breakout could occur. It remains to be seen if it will, but I believe there is a potential trade here to the upside. It is not without downside risk though and that must be taken into consideration.\n\nCurrent thinking in the market is that we may be entering a new bull market based off of recent SP500 closing levels. However, the macroeconomic picture still remains unclear. Particularly in regards to inflation, interest rates, and consumer spending.\n\nIf it is a new bull market, Robinhood may benefit from increased trading activity, but if the macroeconomic picture deteriorates it could degrade Robinhood\u2019s business and affect the stock.\n\nEither way, I personally believe the stock is in an interesting position within the market. The investor meeting is also on June 20th, 2023.\n\nTrade carefully, trade wisely.\n\nTay\n\nMy current position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7d3dcnycv96b1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34d0eb52744ce3374e423b4f72c98f717e614d2e\n\n$HOOD Position from OP\n\n***As always, please consult the appropriate professionals for any financial decisions.

    "selftext": "CAVA has demonstrated that euphoria is back in the IPO market. Shares doubled from initial price talks just because growth is surging indiscriminately every day. Reddit will do the same and may even double as well since 90%+ of braindead retail investors will think it\u2019s a good idea because the site gets so much traffic. But Spez\u2019s interview today cemented why the platform is doomed to fail in the long term. \n\nBy forceably ending the boycotts and installing their own mods a lot of subs will enter a death spiral. The platform already has tens of thousands of unique moderators willing to moderate entirely free and is going to ostracize them. Plus Reddit isn\u2019t even profitable and will probably have to pay off any scabs it implements. No valuation currently makes sense for Reddit because they couldn\u2019t make money even when they had tons of mods working for free. \n\nIf third party apps were so unimportant then Reddit should have been profitable off the desktop site and official first party app, but it\u2019s not. Forcing third party app users to convert to the official app is not going to move the profitability needle at all, especially when considering how many will quit using Reddit altogether. I\u2019ve been on Reddit for 12 years and moderate many subs and would potentially consider leaving entirely. I know there are a lot more like me as well. \n\nIn summary Reddit is one of the rare slam dunk shorts should it even manage to convince an investment bank to pursue a traditional IPO. The other option is a direct listing which would also be disastrous. VIX right now is at 2 year lows meaning puts (namely LEAPS) will be cheap at the outset, and will look even more attractive if Reddit surges day one.",

    "selftext": "A lot of people here will still insist that this recent rally is a big bear trap in the making. But I think we will actually get new All Time High's on the S and P by early 2024. The bear's main thesis is that we are heading to a recession and that earnings will collapse as a result, meaning current valuations are too high.   \n\n\nI used to be in the bear camp but the economy has proven to be too resilient in spite of oil price shocks last year, banks going to receivership this year, and interests rates being raised the fastest in history. The reason why a recession won't happen this year and probably won't happen next year is because too many people are already anticipating for it. This is the most anticipated recession ever. This means companies and CEO's to some degree have already prepared for it by cutting costs and going leaner. Recessions generally happen when we don't expect for it, which is not what we have right now.   \n\n\nLook at the current risks we are all talking about. We talk about an impending commercial real estate bust. We talk about credit crunch because of banks having to raise capital requirements and senior loan officer surveys. Mike Wilson likes to talk about earnings recessions. The reality is we have a lot of cash sidelined because of these worries. So yes I hate saying this but these risks are partially priced in because you have cash sidelined for these worries.  \n\n\nI expect a small pullback soon because things seem exuberant at the moment, but buying on the dip makes the most sense. There is too much cash on the sidelines that can push this market to all time high's. Earlier this year a lot of people went to bonds and money market funds because of these recessionary fears. This will later serve as a catalyst to move stocks higher as that cash will chase performance. In addition, hedge funds are too underweight on stocks and this will also be cash to fuel more upswings.  \n\n\nFinal thoughts... the market likes to do things that people don't expect at all. How about going to all time high's in the face of QT and shrinking M2 supply?  \n\n\nTLDR: Yes you missed the bottom again and you better hop on",

    "selftext": "Hey guys, \n\n I got myself into some insanely wild bad shit crazy situation today and was hoping any of you can help me with this. \n\nSo, I had puts overnight yesterday on my robinhood account (also use a E*trade account). Those were barely up since there was a massive dildo at the end of yesterday that fucked the contracts. I waited for a dip that never came. \n\nThen, I went to my E*trade account and bought a fuck loads of puts. Clearly that died too and at one stage I was down 11.5 k across the two accounts. (I normally use stop losses but I was way too biased today).\n\nI then got an idea of using the robinhood instant deposit for 5k of money that I don\u2019t have. I used that to buy 100 370 qqq calls. Sold and bought 50 qqq 371. Sold that and bought 60 qqq 372. This paid as I recovered 7k from these plays. I then sold everything to try and withdraw the cash I made from thin air into the bank account. However, only 4.5k was allowed to be transferred out. I then bought the remaining money into tmrw expiry puts me which I am swinging overnight. I have kept a margin of 500 bucks cash in my account. \n\nTLDR - account was dying. Took robinhood instant deposit to get 5k. Turned that into 12. Tried withdrawing the cash necessary to cover the deposit but was only allowed to withdraw 4.5k. Therefore, I owe RH 500 bucks. I have 9.3k in my RH though after withdrawing 4.5k and 500 out of that as free cash. Will they forcefully close the position ? Or will they give me another chance ? Or will my bank cover my overdraft since I will only be down by about 300 bucks ?",

    "selftext": "\\*\\*Ticker: JOBY\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Summary\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey fellow apes! I've conducted some serious due diligence on Joby Aviation (JOBY) and it's time to share my findings with the diamond-handed crew at r/wallstreetbets. Joby Aviation is a leading player in the emerging electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) industry, which is set to revolutionize urban mobility. This DD will cover Joby's technology, market potential, key partnerships, and financials, highlighting why this stock could be a moonshot opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*1. Introduction to Joby Aviation\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoby Aviation is an aerospace company focused on developing and commercializing electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. Their eVTOL aircraft are designed to provide on-demand air transportation for urban areas, enabling faster and more efficient travel with reduced carbon emissions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*2. Revolutionary Technology\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoby's aircraft utilize advanced electric propulsion systems, multiple electric motors, and distributed propulsion to achieve vertical takeoff and landing capabilities. These eVTOL vehicles are also equipped with efficient fixed-wing flight, allowing for longer-range operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company's unique aircraft design includes a proprietary quiet and efficient electric powertrain, advanced flight control systems, and an intuitive pilot interface. Joby's technology aims to provide safe, comfortable, and environmentally friendly air transportation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*3. Enormous Market Potential\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe urban air mobility market is projected to experience substantial growth in the coming years. With increasing urbanization, congestion, and the need for sustainable transportation options, eVTOL aircraft are poised to play a significant role in the future of mobility.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoby Aviation is strategically positioned to capture a significant portion of this market. The company has conducted extensive market research, identified target cities, and is actively working on certification and regulatory approvals to initiate commercial operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*4. Key Partnerships\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoby has established crucial partnerships that further enhance its growth prospects:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*Toyota Motor Corporation:\\*\\* Toyota has invested over $400 million in Joby and brings its expertise in manufacturing, quality control, and supply chain management to support Joby's commercialization efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*Uber Technologies Inc. (Uber Elevate):\\*\\* In 2020, Joby acquired Uber's Elevate division, which focused on developing urban air mobility. This partnership provides Joby with access to Uber's vast network, technology, and operational insights.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*NASA:\\*\\* Joby has a NASA Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) partnership, collaborating on infrastructure and airspace management for the future integration of eVTOL aircraft into the National Airspace System.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*5. Financials and Recent Developments\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJoby is a privately held company, and detailed financial information is limited. However, the company has secured significant funding through various funding rounds, including investments from venture capital firms and strategic partners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn February 2023, Joby announced plans to go public through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners (RTP), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). This merger will provide the company with substantial capital to accelerate its commercialization efforts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*6. Risks and Considerations\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs with any investment, there are risks to consider:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*Regulatory hurdles:\\*\\* The eVTOL industry is still in its early stages, and regulatory frameworks need to be established. Delays in certification and approvals could impact Joby's timeline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*Competition:\\*\\* Joby faces competition from other companies entering the eVTOL market. Established aerospace manufacturers and tech giants could pose a challenge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- \\*\\*Execution and scalability:\\*\\* Joby needs to successfully scale up production, establish a robust infrastructure, and secure partnerships with cities and transportation providers to realize its market potential.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Conclusion\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJob\n\n&#x200B;\n\ny Aviation is at the forefront of the eVTOL revolution, with innovative technology, key partnerships, and a solid market positioning. While there are risks involved, the potential upside in the urban air mobility market is immense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis DD is not financial advice, but an overview of Joby Aviation's potential as a long-term investment. Always conduct your own research and consider your risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. Let's discuss, share thoughts, and remember to hold those diamond hands!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR: Joby Aviation is an emerging player in the eVTOL industry, aiming to revolutionize urban air mobility. Their advanced technology, key partnerships, and vast market potential make it an intriguing long-term investment opportunity. Keep an eye on this one, fellow apes!\\*\\*",

They are a SaaS company, SaaS stands for \"Software as a service.\" A software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet. We're going to be going over this in detail later. Like many other cloud-based businesses powered by AI, is poised to generate substantial cash flows in the future. Particularly, Adobe's market is expected to grow at a pace of 13% until 2030. \n\nThe consensus EPS estimate is $3.79, with total revenues between $4.75 billion and $4.78 billion. The consensus mark for the same is pegged at $4.76 billion, implying growth of 8.6% from the year-ago fiscal quarter\u2019s reported figure.\n\nAccording to seeking alpha: \n\n* Over the last 2 years, ADBE has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time.\n\n* Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 19 upward revisions and 4 downward. \n\n* Revenue estimates have seen 15 upward revisions and 7 downward.\n\nThe company on March 15 reported Q1 Non-GAAP EPS of $3.80, ahead of estimates by 12 cents. Revenue of $4.66 billion was up 9.4% from a year ago and topped analyst expectations by at least $40 million.\n\n**Important Factors**\n\nAdobe\u2019s strong focus on its Digital Media business is likely to have aided its performance in the fiscal second quarter. Growing demand for ADBE\u2019s Digital Media Solutions, along with solid momentum across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, is expected to have benefited the Digital Media business in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter. For second-quarter fiscal 2023, Adobe expects Digital Media revenues between $3.45-$3.47 billion.\n\n[Vladimir Dimitrov](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/vladimir-p-dimitrov-cfa-aa754932?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name), leader of the \"The Roundabout Investor\" Investing Group, wrote in a recent analysis, \"The set-up for Adobe's share price remains favourable at least in the short-run. With the narrative around generative AI gaining momentum and sell-side analysts still catching-up, ADBE could continue to outperform the broader market in the coming weeks and even months. \n\nThe rising demand for Photoshop, Lightroom and Premier Pro and solid momentum across the Adobe Express platform might have contributed well to the performance of Creative Cloud. Further, solid enterprise adoption of Acrobat and Adobe Sign is expected to have driven growth in Document Cloud revenues in the to-be-reported fiscal quarter.\n\nApart from Digital Media, strong momentum across Adobe Experience Cloud, on the heels of the rising uptake of Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, is expected to have boosted the business in the fiscal second quarter. Moreover, strength in Workfront might have been another positive.\n\nADBE expects the Digital Experience segment\u2019s revenues to grow 13% from the year-ago fiscal quarter\u2019s actuals. Also, Digital Experience subscription revenues are expected between $1.21 billion and $1.23 billion. Additionally, strong momentum in applications like Real-Time CDP and Adobe Journey Optimizer is likely to have been a tailwind.\n\n**Long Term Gains?**\n\nThe SaaS market is highly competitive, especially when compared to the overall Cloud Market, which is dominated by Amazon (AMZN). However, in the SaaS market, no single company holds a market share larger than 25%. This presents a significant advantage for all the companies operating in the SaaS market, as they can continue to grow without concerns about anti-monopoly laws that might put them in direct conflict with the U.S. Government.\n\nAmong the key players in the SaaS market are Salesforce (CRM), Adobe, Microsoft (MSFT), SAP SE (SAP), Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM), ServiceNow (NOW), and Workday (WDAY). With a market share of 12.50%, [Adobe currently stands as the second-largest SaaS company, trailing behind Salesforce.](https://i.ibb.co/syLN2fb/EORPpAo.png)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Adobe delivers its products through the SaaS model. It is projected that the SaaS market will reach a valuation of $149 billion by 2030, with an estimated revenue of $321.6 billion in 2026. The SaaS market can be categorized [into three segments](https://wetelo.com/blog/digitalization/global-saas-market-size-detailed-analysis): Business & Productivity, Transportation & Logistics, and Circular Economy. As evident, Adobe primarily focuses on the Business & Productivity segment. This specific segment is what's going to be reaching a valuation of $149B by 2030. \n\nSince 2018, [Adobe has experienced](https://i.ibb.co/php2nPr/EORPpAo.png) a remarkable revenue growth of 98%, corresponding to an annual growth rate of 16%. Additionally, its operating income has seen a significant increase of 112%, representing an annual growth rate of 18%. The majority of Adobe's revenue is derived from its [Subscription Revenue](https://i.ibb.co/M9Mk6jZ/MA7ypFK.png), accounting for 96% of the total revenue. As evident, Adobe heavily relies on subscriptions, thus necessitating continuous efforts to maintain its reputation and drive innovation in order to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nWhen it comes to operations, Adobe operates in a market that is already characterized by low capital intensity. Over the years, Adobe has consistently improved its [efficiency ratio](https://i.ibb.co/bRT3Bnv/EORPpAo.png). Moving on to the Balance Sheet section, we can see that Adobe has maintained a relatively healthy financial position. Despite numerous acquisitions, Adobe has managed to keep its [debt level relatively stable](https://i.ibb.co/BBT1K94/MA7ypFK.png). Their cash reserves experienced a staggering 172% increase from 2018 to 2020, and have since remained relatively stable, currently standing at $4.072 billion. Moving on to current assets and liabilities, [look at how](https://i.ibb.co/CztwNRp/MA7ypFK.png) Adobe successfully reduced its current liabilities following the acquisition last year.\n\nOverall Adobe is committed to expansion while maintaining its financial health. They prioritize reinvesting a certain amount of money back into the business whenever it exceeds a predetermined threshold.\n\n**Will they mention AI during Earnings?**\n\nAdobe is focusing on generative AI, introducing features like Firefly and [Generative Fill](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/23/future-of-photoshop-powered-by-adobe-firefly) to enhance its product offerings and user experience. According to the [Adobe Blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2023/05/10/adobe-firefly-adobe-express-google-bard), Firefly's launch in March marked one of the most successful beta launches in the history, generating over 70 million images within the first month. This AI-driven tool relies on a model that leverages hundreds of millions of photos, allowing it to generate both images and text effects based on provided descriptions. In [MoffettNathanson's Inaugural Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference](https://www.ibm.com/investor/events/svb-moffettnathanson-technology-media-and-telecom-conference), the management stated:\n\n> \"If you're Nike, for example, what are you going to want your teams to use? You're going to want them to use a commercially viable model that was trained in the right way, which you can talk about Firefly, plus all the assets that Nike has, right, that hopefully are stored in Creative Cloud or in our AEM system.\"\n\nTherefore, with a focus on incorporating AI into Adobe's products and services, it's easy to believe that Firefly will consist of multiple AI models in the future that will serve various use cases. This is particularly relevant in today's self-media-driven society, including millions of business owners and influencers on TikTok and YouTube Shorts, where the demand for such capabilities is rapidly growing.\n\nAdditionally, I think what makes Firefly stand out from other generative AI tools is its distinctive feature. Firefly will provide the capability to generate images that are safe for commercial use, without infringing on copyrighted materials. The management continued:\n\n> \"They wanted to be a commercially viable asset that has -- we have kind of credentials that can show that it can be used. If they want to sell it or if they want to put it on and have it being add on Instagram or whatever else, there are signals in the market that the commercial viability of assets is going to matter, just like you can't use a copyrighted image on Google necessarily on Instagram.\"\n\nIt's simple to see a comparative advantage for this functionality in the future if Firefly is able to produce copyright-free images that may be utilised directly in ongoing projects with efficiency. Firefly may be used as a time-effective AI tool, enabling users to train and enhance models using their own material, in response to the growing need for AI skills from people and businesses.\n\nIn addition to this, the company's partnership with Google's Bard expands Firefly's reach and potential for increased user engagement. So there's no reason why they wouldn't mention AI at least a hundred times. Users will be able to continue their creative journey seamlessly in Adobe Express. Firefly will enhance and showcase text-to-image capabilities within Bard, allowing users of all skill levels to describe their creative ideas using their own words and generate Firefly images directly within Bard. I believe this integration differentiates Firefly from other generative AI tools in the market, which offers users a more intuitive creative experience.\n\nThe company has demonstrated its dedication to embracing generative AI and fostering creativity among artists and content creators. Generative Fill, powered by Firefly in Photoshop (beta), will be available to the public in 2H CY2023. I think all these AI features will add value to their service, and can even be treated as a standalone subscription model. Despite a recent 32% rally due to the AI optimism, the stock is currently trading at 32x P/E TTM, which is lower than the 5-year average of 40x. Therefore, I'm bullish on ADBE.\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nGiven Adobe's [previous track record of beating consensus projections for its quarterly results](https://i.ibb.co/Mn1mnVH/EORPpAo.png), it wouldn't be surprising if the firm once again exceeded them. This, along with the compelling AI storyline, might result in a significant reaction in the company's share price. Contracts are expensive so I'll be getting a call spread. I'll be buying the 6/16 500c for a whopping $1400, and selling the 520c for $830. This means I can get the call spread for $570, offering a maximum gain of 3.6x if the stock moves up 6% - which is the average move with earnings. Keep in mind tho, this post is meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.

The pause cycle is a coin  flip between a flat market that ends down on the year or a multi year uptrend. But the ONE THING that is in common with all crashes is that the fed starts to CUT and that 1st CUT is the most bearish signal you could possibly hope for as it means something is actually wrong and not just speculatorily wrong. \n\nUse this information how you will.

Many crops depend on the monsoon for timely planting, reservoir replenishment, and rebuilding soil moisture. India\u2019s monsoon is falling further behind, putting crop production at risk. Wheat, sugar, and rice are three markets traders should be watching, but sugar and then ethanol may be the most at risk today.\n\nThe normal progression of the monsoon is the lower third of the country covered by June 10 and the southern and western half by June 15. Today, barely 20% of the south has received moisture. Temperatures have been sweltering due to the strengthening of El Ni\u00f1o and the tendency for the monsoon to disappoint. The following two weeks will be critical for the monsoon to catch up or fall further behind.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest population has a massive sweet tooth, and the ethanol industry has exploded, making India the world\u2019s largest consumer. The country relies on domestic production to supply much of its demand. Global prices are already at decade highs due to years of underinvestment in the industry globally.\n\nBrazil\u2019s export capacity will be limited due to its massive grain program already underway.

    "title": "$DAL - No Respect & No Love",
    "selftext": "The airlines continue to get no respect, led by Delta Air Lines ($DAL). Anyone just needs to look at the recent rally in the cruise line sector to see how the stock market is irrationally negative on the airlines. The investment thesis remains ultra Bullish on airline stocks like Delta.\n\nFor the last year, the market has told investors to not buy airline stocks due to an impending recession. Airlines like Delta have made tons of money and returned to cash flow positive, yet the stock hasn't rallied from the early 2021 levels when signs existed that travel demand would rebound from the covid destruction.\n\nThe amazing part here is that the cruise lines were about a year behind the airlines in removing covid restrictions and returning to profits and positive cash flows. Most airlines reported strong profits starting in Q2'22, though Delta reported small profits at the end of 2021.\n\nCruise lines like Carnival Corp. ($CCL) and Royal Caribbean ($RCL) were still reporting large losses in the last couple of quarters. In fact, the forecast is for Carnival to report another large loss for the just ended May quarter due to the inclusion of March in the quarterly results.\n\nIn essence, the airlines are far ahead of the cruise lines in the travel recovery, but oddly the stocks have underperformed. For the YTD period, Royal Caribbean and Carnival have seen share price gains of ~93% versus the solid, but much smaller, 28% gain for Delta.\n\nThe amazing part is that Delta has forecast a return to near record EPS in 2024. The airline is forecasting an EPS of up $6 this year for a stock trading at only $42 now.\n\nWhile Royal Caribbean has a goal of hitting a record EPS in 2025, the cruise line is only now starting to generate profits. Carnival has no such plan to return to record profits anytime soon, but the stock has rallied anyway.\n\nA prime example of the disconnect here are the forward PE ratios. Delta trades at only 6x PE targets while Royal Caribbean is now up at 14x and Carnival trades at a market multiple of 19x.\n\nThe share price move is strange considering Delta is in a better financial position, having returned to positive cash flows sooner. Logic would say the casino is missing an obvious big play in $DAL.\n\nCheck The Balance Sheet\nA big key to the forecasts of Delta is the return to large positive cash flows. Previously, the airline returned billions in capital to shareholders annually via mainly stock buybacks and now these cash flows will repay debt.\n\nDelta ended Q1 with net debt of $15.4 billion, but the company still has debt far above pre-covid levels. The airline forecasts a combination of lower capex and higher income, leading to over $6 billion in positive cash flows through the end of 2024 to drive net debt far lower.\n\nThe airline should end 2024 with net debt back towards the early 2020 levels. Delta Air Lines should generate $4+ billion in annual free cash flows starting in 2024, leaving the airline with the options of either pushing towards positive cash balances or starting to repurchase extremely cheap shares here.\n\nOne of the biggest aspects missed by the business return to normalization is that the loyalty plan offers a huge revenue boost over 2019 levels. Delta works with American Express ($AXP) on Delta Skymiles and the remuneration from the plan has grown from $4 billion in 2019 to a goal of $7+ billion in 2024.\n\nThese high margin revenues provide a huge upside to the potential profits versus the $7.33 earned back in 2019. As the interest expenses are cut back to pre-covid levels or lower, investors should start looking at the potential for Delta to earn $8 to $9 per share in 2025 and beyond.\n\nTakeaway\nThe key investor takeaway is that Delta remains cheap. The stock should trade at an equivalent, or higher, forward PE multiple than the cruise lines. The airline remains on a solid path to hitting the $7+ EPS target in 2024 and the stock should ultimately follow the debt repayments Delta will undertake in the next year to much higher prices.\n\nFalling energy prices and the AMEX remunerations are additional catalysts for faster profits and cash flow.",

Filtering for this criteria, I got a group of 167 with an average ADAS-Cog of 19.0 (\u00b12.6) at baseline. At 12 months, this comparison group had an average ADAS-Cog score of 25.7 (\u00b110.2).\n\nComparing these data to the Simufilam open-label group at 12 months, who had ADAS-Cog score of 19.1 (SD\u00b19.2) at baseline and 19.6 (\u00b113.3) at 12 months, I did a two-sample Z-test and found a z-score of -5.079. This score is quite impressive, as it's over 5 standard deviations below the mean. This indicates a very significant difference with p < 0.00001.\n\nThis was an exercise in trying to predict what a comparison group may look like and comes from preliminary data, so should not be considered a medical or diagnostic test or evaluation. I also only had limited information from the Cassava Press Release, so it is not a proper analysis, again just an exercise.\n\n\\*\\*Data used were obtained from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu).

    "title": "$DAC - Analysis and DD - A 2023 Deep Value Play",
    "selftext": "**INTRODUCTION**\n\nThe Danaos Corporation ($DAC) is a freight charter company. It is heavily undervalued by numerous metrics - trading at a EV/EBITDA of 1.89, 0.52 P/B, a 3.52x P/E, and a 0.18x Debt/Equity multiple. As a freight charter company which owns the majority of its vessels, it is not directly subject to changing freight rates, although it is exposed to changing supply and demand as well as high capital dependance. Companies in the shipping industry are often viewed as a risky investment due to low ROCs and heavy competition - however, this company is currently at a massive discount, and its exposure to risk is limited as 2/3 of the current revenue is contracted until 2025 at the (high) COVID-19 spot rates. Furthermore, these contracts are with liners that are in great financial health, due to the previous few years of high cash flows in the shipping industry. As of June 13, 2023, the average contract for their fleet is at 20 months. $100 million in share buybacks were announced in 2022, of which $40 million have already been purchased. Currently, there is a 4.73% annual dividend yield with a payout ratio of approximately 11.9%.\n\n**GENERAL RISKS**\n\nThe firm is at its highest ever point in free cash flow - contracted EBITDA locked in contracts over the next 3 years are more than its current Enterprise Value. With the high amount of earnings that are already locked in contracts, the only valid risk at this time are the spot rates their vessels will be subject to in the future in the case of a recession. However, this risk only applies to the 1/3 of revenue that is not locked in future contracts. Going into the future, newly imposed environmental regulations may cause reduced revenue when considering the fact that new vessels will be introduced to the market 2023 onwards, and environmental checks required for older ships may increase future costs. I do anticipate that this risk is currently overblown for Danaos because of it's sizable young portion of its fleet. Given that it is a charter company and not a liner, it faces less exposure to volatility. The return on Capital averages at 7-11%, which is not a high amount. The 0.52x NAV multiple does provide significant downside protection, however.\n\n**MANAGEMENT**\n\nDr. John Coustas is the current CEO and President of the company. He assumed management of the company from his father (who founded the company in 1982) in 1987. He holds degrees in Marine Engineering, Computer Science, and Computer Controls. With a 44% stake, CEO John Coustas is the largest shareholder. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 2.4% and 2.3% of the stock. His stake likely means he is largely in charge of decisions made at the company. Given he has over 30 years in shipping experience with the firm, he may place his main incentive on steady growth instead of attempting to maximize shareholder returns, although this might be balanced by other incentives due to his large stake in the company. The average age of a vessel on the Danaos fleet is 11 years - for reference, depreciation of these vessels starts at ages ranging from 25-30 years. It is possible that current older vessels may be used for additional periods due to the obscenely high recent spot rates (this may be reduced after the intiation of environmental regulation) Around $530 million was committed in 2021 to building 6 new vessels, which will be delivered in 2024. Prior to this, another 6 second hand vessels were purchased for $270 million in 2021- these second hand vessels have currently yielded around 8% in adjusted earnings. The company was under extensive strain after the GCF until COVID due to a high level of debt and low charter rates - this prior history may impact the actions which the management of the company undertake with their current cash.\n\n**RELIABILITY OF LONG TERM CONTRACT CUSTOMER BASE**\n\nDue to the recent increase in cash flows which shipping companies experienced during COVID, large numbers of shipping companies are in extremely (historically) healthy financial positions. Furthermore, the majority of Danaos' contracts are Industry Standard Charter Contracts - this means that they are not cancellable and are not subject to renegotiation or change unless in the case of a restructuring or bankruptcy. In past years (during which the shipping industry was under far greater strain than it is now), Danaos received full compensation from ZIM when it restructured in 2014 in addition to when HMM restructured in 2016 in the form of equity. However, in the case of Hanjin's bankruptcy, no vessel owners received compensation which contributed to Danaos recording a net loss of $366 million in 2016, down from a net profit of $117 Million in 2015 (it is worth noting that the period was also of a general industry turndown). CMA GM (22%), M SC (15%), and HMM (15%) were the 3 biggest charter contract companies for Danaos in 2022.In the Q3 earning call for GSL (a Danaos competitor with a customer base which partly overlaps with the firm), Ian Webber (CEO) said - \u201cFurther, we have industry standard charter contracts, they're noncancelable. We only deal with the really good names. We've never had a bad debt in GSL. It kind of doesn't happen in our industry by and large, anyway. Liner companies are desperate for these ships. They need the charter fleet to run their scheduled services. Without the ships, they don't have services. So it's in their own interest to behave properly. And as George said, they're in the best financial shape they've probably ever been in..\u201d - this summarizes my conviction on the matter. The already low risks of customer bankruptcy are also somewhat mitigated by the firms diverse customer base (their largest customer accounts for 25% of their revenue, followed by the second largest customer at approximately 16%). This risk is already low because of the fact that liner companies have recently come out of a cash flow windfall.\n\n**EFFECT OF CONTAINERSHIP AVAILABILITY ON FUTURE CHARTER RATES AND REVENUE**\n\nThe magnitude of TEU vessels scrapped decreased from highs in 2016 to \\~1% in 2020, to \\~0% in 2022. The recent increase in charter rates has caused numerous charter firms to run older ships for additional time in spite of higher operational costs. This increase in vessel deployment and utilization is further evidenced by the fact that the idle fleet ratio has fallen to 1.6% in recent years. Vessel orders have been placed with anticipated deliveries between 2023-2025, and the increase in Danaos' net shipping capacity is \\~12.8%. Supply of these ships face a diminishing threat due to environmental regulations which will soon require corrective anti-pollution modifications to a portion of \\~80% of the current world fleet which can be classified as aged. Danaos is at a smaller exposure to this risk because of a large number of young vessels it owns. Additionally, the influx in supply of eco-friendly ships to the market in future years may have a damage on Danaos' revenue, but the large number of non-cancelable contracts provides protection against this. The market share is currently concentrated amongst a smaller number of larger liner companies due to many smaller firms having faced bankruptcy in recent years - this increase in supply side power could allow the maintenance of higher freight and therefore charter rates, which could have an adverse effect on the aforementioned supply shifters, benefiting Danaos. To combat the constrictors of supply, significant orders will be met from 2023-2025, and a sizable portion of these orders will be at a capacity over 10000 TEU, while Danaos may have a smaller risk of loss due to its orders which are under 10000 TEU.\n\n**CATALYST**\n\nI think sheer value can act as a catalyst for the stock as it shows consistent earnings due to the contracted future cash flows. More media coverage as the stock increases and shows consistent earnings could also have a similar effect. In recent times, the media coverage has been low due to the fact that the firm was unestablished and not immensely profitable until after COVID.",

    "selftext": " \n\nThe FOMC is expected to leave rates unchanged at 5.00-5.25%.\n\nThe accompanying 'Dot Plot' will go a long way in addressing the unchanged decision as a 'pause' or a 'skip', where the absence of an increase to the 2023 median rate dot will struggle to see the 'skip' nomenclature hold ground, reflecting diminishing power amongst the hawks.\n\nDoves will be hesitant to back guidance around further hikes over fears of a future event in the banking sector, a view that appears more in line with the Fed hierarchy than not.\n\n### SKIP/PAUSE:\n\nThe FOMC is expected to keep its target Fed Funds range unchanged at 5-5.25%, according to the majority of economists, while markets are currently implying a 25% risk of a 25bps hike and almost fully pricing in a hike for the July meeting. The statement will most likely continue to affirm that \"additional policy firming may be appropriate\", with little changes expected. Expectations over whether the Fed would hike or pause/skip have been erratic heading into the confab given resilient economic data supporting hike calls from hawks, but the voting member majority have ultimately signalled against a hike in order to assess cumulative tightening so far and the impact of recent bank failures - a notion that Fed Vice Chair nominee Jefferson formalised on the eve of the FOMC blackout period. But, while Board leadership are mainly on the same page, the growing rift between hawks and doves may become more evident, with Bloomberg's economist survey showing nearly 40% of expect a hawkish dissent on Wednesday. A failure to convince the hawks that the June FOMC is a skip would likely be the trigger for a dissent.\n\n### CPI RISK:\n\nThe May CPI report will be released just as the FOMC two-day meeting begins on Tuesday and serves as a significant event risk. Wall Street consensus sees Core CPI Y/Y falling to 5.3% from 5.5%, with the M/M seen flat at +0.4%. Some economists have made their unchanged June Fed rate meeting forecasts contingent on the inflation data coming in line as expected, so any upside surprises Tuesday (particularly in the Fed-favoured core services ex-housing derivation) will no doubt push up the probability of a hike on Wednesday, if not reinforce hawkish guidance at the very least with the report adding to the solid non-farm payrolls additions in May. On the other hand, doves may instead point to the lagging nature of CPI data and instead point to the softening of indicators such as ISMs and PMIs, the recent pick-up in initial jobless claims, and the spike in the unemployment rate (and falling hours worked) as all warranting a pause in aggregation. DOT PLOT: The Fed will also release its updated edition of the Summary of Economic Projections ('Dot Plot') after the prior release at the March FOMC. Bloomberg's economist survey, conducted between June 2nd-7th, sees no change expected to the 2023 year-end rate of 5.1% (money markets are almost fully priced for a hike in July followed by a cut in December), although if the Fed wants to ramp its hawkish guidance, there is a sizeable minority who expect an increase to 5.3%. Beyond there, consensus sees the 2024-end forecast raised to 3.8% from 3.6%, 2025 seen at 3.1% from 3.0%, and the long-run ('neutral') rate is seen unchanged at 2.5% - keep an eye on any upward pressure in the long-run dot as many question whether if we now have a higher neutral interest rate, particularly as where the Fed may land at comes more into focus as the end of the rate hiking cycle comes into sight. Economists also expect upgrades to 2023's growth forecast to 0.6% from 0.4%, cuts to the 2023 unemployment rate to 4.2% from 4.5%, and a nudge higher in Core PCE to 3.7% from 3.6%.\n\n### Bloomberg survey's median dot expectations: FEDERAL FUNDS RATE:\n\n5.1% in 2023 (unchanged vs. March), 4.4% in 2024 (prev. 4.3%), 3.1% in 2025 (unchanged), 2.5% in longer run (unchanged) CHANGE IN REAL GDP: 0.6% in 2023 (prev. 0.4% in March), 1.2% in 2024 (unchanged), 1.9% in 2025 (unchanged), 1.8% in longer run (unchanged). UNEMPLOYMENT RATE: 4.2% in 2023 (prev. 4.5% in March), 4.5% in 2024 (prev. 4.6%), 4.5% in 2025 (prev. 4.6%), 4.0% in longer run (unchanged) PCE INFLATION: 3.3% in 2023 (unchanged vs. March), 2.5% in 2024 (unchanged), 2.1% in 2025 (unchanged), 2.0% in longer run (unchanged) CORE PCE INFLATION: 3.7% in 2023 (prev. 3.6% in March), 2.6% in 2024 (unchanged), 2.1% in 2025 (unchanged).\n\n### BANKING FEARS:\n\nWhile there have been no further ruptures from the banking sector after the fallout from the SVB failure, it's the fears that something might occur going forward which is driving significant caution from doves, particularly as bank reserves continue on their downward trajectory; the TGA rebuild only adds to those uncertainties. Indeed, there are likely to be several who are reluctant to give any guidance towards further hikes, and a failure to increase the 2023 rate dot will see Powell struggle to frame an unchanged rates decision on Wednesday as part of the nascent 'skip' narrative that hawks have been pining for (given they can't garner enough votes for a hike). Markets are more than likely to see that scenario as a 'pause' and begin to ponder more meaningfully when we can expect cuts.\n\n### GLOBAL FORCES:\n\nThe surprise hikes by the RBA and then the BoC recently have raised some fears that the Fed could follow suit. However, that seems unlikely in the near term, absent an upside surprise to CPI, with money markets relatively unchanged for the June meeting. Nonetheless, there has been a greater unwind of cuts priced into next year in the wake of the surprise hikes.

    "selftext": "Hello fellow degens, this is a followup for my DD on Nvidia:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd\\_nvda\\_to\\_700\\_by\\_this\\_time\\_next\\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13lb98n/dd_nvda_to_700_by_this_time_next_year/)\n\nI'll have you know that since I posted that, NVDA has gone up 40% and I'm quite handsomely profitable. I still think Nvidia is a winner and I am holding my position. Also an interesting fact is I was the first person in the market to buy that particular call strike/date, but now the OI on that call is 635. Its now the highest OI OTM NVDA call out of any long term dates, and I'm going to take credit for all the other regards that bought into that call. **So a total of $5.8M was invested because of my last DD on just that option alone, and there's probably a lot more investment that can be attributed to my post. You're welcome regards.**\n\n**This post is about AMD's newly announced Instinct MI300**, which is their contender for best AI chip. The release was met with lukewarm reaction from the market, and my guess is because it didn't include ASIC tensor units like Nvidia's H100. However, it still is going to be competitive in AI and it boils down to this:\n\n**Processing speed isn't everything.**\n\nThe H100 will blow the MI300 out of the water when it comes to raw processing speed and raw processing efficiency for AI tasks, but the MI300 does have one trick up its sleeve: very high memory capacity and very high memory bandwidth.\n\n**Where the H100 has 80 GB of memory per card, and the MI300 has 192 GB per chip.**\n\nMemory is critical for large language models (LLMs), because the top models now need over 100 GB of memory to run efficiently -- meaning no single GPU can run them currently. You can split up the memory of the models onto multiple cards or keep some of the model in RAM, but this dramatically slows down calculations. For this reason, memory is a HUGE bottleneck for LLMs.\n\n**The MI300 will be the only option for extremely large models (the smartest ones) when it comes out in Q2.**\n\nFurthermore the MI300 has another trick up its sleeve: Its HBM memory is directly on chip integrated into the AMD Infinity Fabric bus, as compared to Nvidia's cards where the HBM is on separate chips on the card. This means AMD inherently can get much higher memory bandwidth. Estimates are 8TB/s for the MI300 vs 2-3 TB/S for the H100. This will mean that tensors can be loaded into the MI300's GPU more efficiently causing less latency (downtime) for the processing units.\n\nMore interesting facts about the MI300:\n\n* It is an APU, meaning it has both a GPU and a CPU\n* The CPU is a basically like a 24 core Ryzen\n* The GPU is like smashing over two 7900XTX's together (its titanic)\n* This is one of the largest ICs ever at 146B transistors (The H100 is 80B transistors)\n\nWhat does all this mean?\n\n* **For non-AI compute workloads the MI300 is likely to be the king of efficiency out of any available products** \\-- it will be widely deployed in supercomputers across the world. Their first flagship customer is the DOE, which owns a large portion of the largest super computers in the world.\n* **Also for the largest AI workloads, it will be the only good option for a few months until the H100 NVL comes out**\n\nHow does it stack against the H100 NVL? The NVL model is a new version of the H100 coming out in the second half of the year. It is basically like a normal H100 that is capable of SLI (NVLink). This allows users to put two H100 NVLs together via a special link so they operate like one logical compute unit. That will give Nvidia a 188 GB option (via 2 cards linked together). However NVLink has extremely poor memory bandwidth which will exacerbate the difference between the MI300's extremely good memory bandwidth. Its hard to say whether the H100 NVL solution will be better than the MI300 for very large language models, but my guess is the H100 NVL will probably be better for most. The MI300 will be excellent for them however, so its likely that many cloud providers will chose it because it is also fantastic for general purpose OpenCL where the H100 is a specialized card.\n\nWhat am I doing? I'm buying some AMD in addition to my NVDA. I've also bought some SMH calls which have exposure to both NVDA and AMD. I'm at about 4:1 exposure NVDA:AMD right now, but I'll bring that up to 2:1.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6yr8drxuwz5b1.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=191587a0f1b97d81cebe663faf006274643576ae\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5hgd1odywz5b1.png?width=955&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=886d659e1a719e74d517144d7f812ec6447f7de2",

This process used to be done through local connections, but, with XMTR's platform, this can be done much faster, cheaper, and at greater volume.\n\n\u00b7 They are doing this in a ginormous total addressable market sized at $2 trillion for global manufacturing where they only had revenue of $381 million for all of last year (but grew 75%!).\n\n\u00b7 XMTR is a newer company and in the early innings of user awareness where they have seen customers in industries from electric vehicle manufacturers, aerospace and defense, pharmaceuticals, consumer technology all grow spend at compounded annual growth rates between 121% up to 993%.\n\n\u00b7 Being the outright winner as a marketplace/having a first mover advantage is important as you can see with AirBnb, Amazon, and Uber who have won early to create significant value from digitizing their markets. Looking back, wouldn\u2019t you have invested in Amazon at Day 1?\n\n\u00b7 This is playing out as competitors like [Fast Radius](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chicago-tech-company-fast-radius-files-for-chapter-11-after-the-spac-deal-216941/) and [Shapeway\u2019s](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/shapeways-hit-with-nyse-non-compliance-notice-for-failing-to-meet-listing-standards-214028/) have either gone bankrupt or are very close.\n\n**AI & Positive Feedback Loops**\n\n\u00b7 So, what\u2019s the special sauce? [Artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/) and machine learning. They continue to create a positive feedback loop where every buyer attracts more sellers and thus attracts more buyers. For those of you who haven't attended an intro to business webinar like I have, this phenomenon is called a network effect.\n\n\u00b7 This entire flywheel is powered by the droves of quality data they are collecting. Proper pricing, matching, and lead times between product developers and the 625,000 manufacturers in the USA alone is difficult and takes YEARS to develop since it has never been done before.\n\n\u00b7 While they have had some hiccups that hurt near term numbers and caused some bears to huddle up, they now have better data and algorithms than anyone else in the market and have better trained their machines which keeps competitors from coming anywhere close to competing with them. I love a good moat, don\u2019t you?\n\n*\\*NOT TO MENTION\\* there are 10,000 owners of manufacturing shops retiring and selling their businesses every day to engineers that understand and have a use for XMTR\u2019s tech offering.*\n\n**A Good Deal**\n\n\u00b7 NVIDIA (NVDA) is trading at 20x sales and XMTR is at \\~ 2x sales.

    "selftext": "  \n\nOkay, before I ask my question, please understand that I understand the economy of the 1980's and the economy of the 2020's is most likely way different, but with that being said, how is it possible that Jerome Powell and his crew only had to raise rates by measly amounts for a little over a year and half to supposedly get the economy back to healthy inflation levels, whereas Paul Volcker on the other hand:\n\n\"The Federal Reserve board led by Volcker raised the federal funds rate, which had averaged 11.2% in 1979, to a peak of 20% in June 1981. The prime rate rose to 21.5% in 1981 as well, which helped lead to the 1980\u20131982 recession, in which the national unemployment rate rose to over 10%.\"\n\nSo, it appears that Paul's version of fixing the inflation problem in the 1980's was to drastically increase interest rates, which inevitably led to a recession and high unemployment, whereas Jerome's version barely raised rates, and kept everything else including unemployment historically low.\n\nNow, either Paul and crew were so much dumber than Jerome and crew, or something isn't adding up. Could what Jerome and crew just did really avoid a recession, high unemployment, and actually lead to another bull run... how could Paul and company have been so wrong at choosing a tactic to combat inflation or is the current fix just an illusion.\n\nI am so confused and want to understand how by just raising interest rates for in the grand scheme of things a short period of time could actually fix such a broken economy, with such out of control debt and continued spending... please make this all make sense and thank you in advance!",

The market's reaction to Nasdaq's largest-ever acquisition sent shockwaves through the industry, causing widespread selling pressure and rattling investor confidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The substantial decline resulted in NDAQ shares opening significantly lower, trading just above their year-to-date lows of approximately $52, a level reminiscent of the mid-March slump.

This ratio, lower than 95% of readings from the past year, suggests that traders hold bullish expectations, anticipating a possible recovery in the stock's price in the near future.  \n>  \n>The market's reaction to Nasdaq's sharp decline has led to a compelling situation for options traders. Options on NDAQ are currently priced relatively affordably, with NDAQ's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) reading at 19%, placing it in the very low 3rd percentile compared to readings from the past 12 months. This low SVI implies that options traders are factoring in lower-than-expected levels of volatility, indicating a perceived stability in the stock's future performance.\n\n&#x200B;",

I was thinking about it and clearly market wants to go up and clearly its not sensible long term to fight this bull trend\u2026 so I was thinking the fact that the VIX was at precovid lows and back in the 13s really made it difficult for the VIX to go much lower which really makes it difficult for SPY to go much higher\u2026 what if with CPI and FOMC back to back and a nice pump on the VIX\u2026 that this is the vehicle SPY needed to pump to 440-450 now\u2026\n\nThink about it\u2026 SPY loves to unwind with the VIX and despite an 8% pump yesterday SPY did not drop lower\u2026 what if not when the VIX unwinds back to the low to mid 13s SPY finally has the momentum to push this to that 450 area? \n\nJust a thought\u2026 \n\nHowever then I take a look at the FG index and I see it sitting at 80\u2026 the 2nd highest level its been in the last year\u2026 Actually since July 2021\u2026 the FG index has only seen 80 or higher two times now. \n\nLets take a look at that once again\u2026\n\nNovember 9th 2021 the FG hit 77 and SPX was $4685\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $4513 and an FG index of 25 on December 1st. That would be a 3.8% drop. \n\nDecember 1st 2022 the FG hit 76 and SPX was $4077\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3850 and an FG index of 37 on December 29th 2022\u2026 That would be a 5.9% drop.\n\nFebruary 1st 2023 the FG index hit 82 (the highest level in the last 2 years) and SPX was $4119\u2026 SPX then fell to a low of $3856 and FG index hit 23 on March 13th 2022\u2026 that would be a 6.8% drop.\n\nSo on average over the last two years when the FG index has peaked at these levels\u2026 SPX has seen a 5.5% drop over 19 trading days\u2026 \n\nThat COULD mean if we are peaking here at FG 79 and SPX $4369 then we COULD see a drop to $4128 or SPY $412.5 by July 12th\u2026 However, if SPY pumps to $440 tomorrow that could look more like SPY $416\u2026 \n\nThis all plays into my theory that tomorrow FOMC will be a local top and Thursday minimally (perhaps Friday) could be a juicy retrace\u2026 \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xyv8utnptu5b1.png?width=859&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2b7d147c5b973614eca60b6ef96d9b3866086fc4\n\n(note that last call on SPX was a 1dte not sure why it says 2 thats an error)\n\nI am actually incredibly pleased with myself today and my trading results\u2026 I pretty much went into today thinking that \u201cthis retrace is an opportunity to go long on a call\u201d now of course I took some puts and I did win nicely on some of those puts\u2026 today was low % win types of day because 0dte premiums were so high in the AM and then when you switch to 1dte your premiums are so juicy you don\u2019t see much of a win\u2026 \n\nOverall though a great day of trading where I was able to make up all of yesterdays losses and then some\u2026 \n\nI have said it before and ill say it again\u2026 risk management is the key to success and profitability\u2026 Yesterday I struggled for sure and had a red day\u2026 however, I was able to successfully manage and mitigate those losses to the point where one trading day got me back to green and back up over my daily profit goal (if you subtracted yesterdays losses from todays wins). \n\nI look forward to trading tomorrow and some of the volatility that will follow with that!",

According to DigiTimes, TSMC plans to increase its CoWoS capacity from 8,000 wafers per month to 11,000 wafers per month by the end of this year and aims to reach around 20,000 wafers per month by the end of 2024. However, even with this expansion, it is anticipated that Nvidia will consume approximately half of the capacity available at that time. AMD is also reportedly seeking additional CoWoS capacity for next year.  \n>  \n>The growing demand for technologies such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI), and high-performance computing (HPC) is driving the adoption of complex multi-chiplet designs, exemplified by products like AMD's Instinct MI300 and Nvidia's H100. Nvidia, in particular, is considered the primary beneficiary of the increasing demand for AI-focused compute GPUs and currently controls over 90% of compute GPU shipments for new deployments. Consequently, TSMC is facing challenges in meeting the demand for its CoWoS advanced packaging solutions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Presently, TSMC has the capacity to process approximately 8,000 CoWoS wafers per month, with Nvidia and AMD utilizing about 70% to 80% of this capacity. Following them, Broadcom represents the third-largest user, accounting for around 10% of the available CoWoS wafer processing capacity. The remaining capacity is divided among 20 other fabless chip designers.  \n>  \n>Expanding CoWoS capacity requires specialized production tools, and their lead times typically range from three to six months. Hence, TSMC's ability to rapidly increase its CoWoS capacity is constrained.",

They did not invent it BUT are doing a great job of holding their installed base with it.   The barrier to entry is LOW.  PCI interfaces, memory structures and Tensorcores are all pedestrian readily available tech. NOBODY has a monopoly on it. No moat.\n\nSeveral other players are also making purpose built AI clusters that scale well beyond anything NVIDIA can even do.   Watch for acquisitions. \n\n[Cerebras](https://www.cerebras.net/)",

Furthermore, almost half of the respondents, 46%, express a lack of trust in AI when it comes to providing financial advice. Interestingly, despite these concerns, there is a noteworthy 20% of investors who remain open to the idea of using AI advisors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>However, what investors may not realize is that AI is already being employed in their financial decision-making processes. Digitally-native personal finance management tools such as Mint and NerdWallet, which inherently require machine learning and AI for efficient operation, are already leveraging AI behind the scenes. Similarly, robo-advisors, which offer automated, algorithm-based portfolio management services to investors, are powered by AI. In fact, robo-advisors are projected to manage a staggering $2.76 trillion in assets this year, highlighting the significant role of AI in this domain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Moreover, AI plays a crucial part in other aspects of finance as well.

    "selftext": "So recently Disney has decided to scale back marketing for Indy 5 and the new Star Wars project the Acolyte. They already acknowledged that both projects are over budget and expect them to tank. Made a chunk of money a month ago on puts and now i think it looks good to repeat the process.\n\nKeep in mind they sunk over a billion dollars on their star wars hotel just to have it open for less than a year and finally put an axe to it. Now there is rumors about selling Lucasfilm back to George Lucas himself.\n\nOh yeah, almost forgot; Disney tanked Willow another Lucas property. At this rate, I wonder if Disney would be selling Lucasfilm at a loss?\n\nIts genuinely baffling why Disney has not about faced with Star wars and Lucasfilm. I know the long term whale investors are pissed off at Kathleen Kennedy. You can say what you want about woke this and that or that the pandemic changed the markets but numbers don\u2019t lie. Lucasfilm is bleeding money and in life support and yet Kathleen Kennedy keeps running the company into the ground. On top of that, they fired Chapek who was there for about 2 years and re-hired Iger who put Disney in this mess to begin with. The man is an acquisition guy and it shows. Disney is now top heavy with stuff but no real leadership or vision to manage it.  They might as well be a media monopoly and yet they are sinking like the Titanic. A monopoly shouldn\u2019t lose money at all.\n\nSo what\u2019s the play?\n\nEdit:\n\nThe rumor of the sale to Lucas comes from an apparently high bill owed to Comcast.\n\nThought i would add some more DD. Disney has had slow park attendance since the pandemic and with consumers carrying $5k in credit card debt month to month Disney is expecting a small turnout to their parks globally.\n\nGiven the extended covid restrictions in California among other economic and environmental issues, I\u2019m not sure that Disney park will ever turn around.\n\nDisney has also been hit with a class action lawsuit after modifying annual pass holders contract.\n\nMarvel is also on a death spiral. Comic books are near death with both Marvel and DC comic book sales reaching all time lows. Meanwhile, Marvel movies are barely limping along. Although the recent Guardians movie was genuinely pretty good, ticket sales were less than expected.\n\nI don\u2019t think I need to mention the losses from the little Mermaid movie. I think the little mermaid ride at the magic kingdom should have been a tip off that no one would give a shit.\n\nToy sales are non-existent, with countless marvel and star wars toys ending up on clearance or returned to the manufacturer. Let\u2019s not forget the Grogu doll fiasco; once they finally made the doll Christmas had already come and gone and no one gave a shit when they finally hit shelves.\n\nLastly, Disney Plus keeps seeing huge dips in subscribers. There does appear to be boycotting of its shows but i think the main driver is that no one can afford it since they keep raising the price tag.",

However, the legality of such actions is not a straightforward matter. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Representative, recently introduced the SEC Stabilization Act with the explicit purpose of dismissing Gensler. Gensler has been serving as the head of the SEC since April 2021, and his term is expected to continue until 2026.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>While Davidson has made serious allegations of misconduct and abuse of power against Gensler, removing an independent agency official who was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate is a complex process. It is unclear if the President has the sole authority to fire an SEC commissioner. According to a legal expert, there needs to be a valid cause for forcing an SEC official to leave their position. A Supreme Court decision in 2010 established that commissioners can only be removed by the President under specific circumstances, such as inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Unlike cabinet secretaries who serve at the pleasure of the President and can be asked to leave at any time, removing an SEC commissioner is more challenging. Expelling fellow lawmakers from Congress also requires a two-thirds vote and has been a rare occurrence in U.S. history, happening only 20 times.  \n>  \n>Davidson introduced the SEC Stabilization Act in response to a tweet from Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase. If this legislation becomes law, it would restructure the SEC by adding a sixth member to the commission, which currently consists of four commissioners and one chairperson. It would also redistribute certain powers from the chairperson to the commissioners.  \n>  \n>Some media companies reached out to the SEC for comment, but a spokesperson declined to provide any statement.\n\n[House Republicans introduce bill to remove SEC Chair Gary Gensler, restructure agency](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-introduce-bill-remove-sec-chair-gary-gensler)\n\n&#x200B;",

Because we actually turned the 429.68 supply from the August 16th top into a demand (support) today\u2026 that means now 430 is actually considered supported and \u201cjustified.\u201d\n\nTo keep it simple upside target is 437.87 demand and downside target would be new 429.86 demand. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4jadpbncn5b1.png?width=1016&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=50237eb6eef42ffaf8cce79174330407a65ca9d0\n\nWe remain in this black bull channel which gives us an upside target of 438.1 tomorrow (support from April 21 2022) and then in the case of a drop 429.8 is not considered strong support. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 429.13 -> 445.34  \n Demand- 429.86 -> 437.87  \n Support- 430.9 -> 429.8 -> 429.2  \n Resistance- 433.91 -> 435.7 -> 438\n\n**FUTURES**\n\nNote- TOS rolled its contract over the weekend so I will be holding off on charting any levels or sharing that here until that is done\u2026 by Friday we should have a more normalized chart on futes to update and share.\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l984ugvncn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f06641efbed95f2496cff3aeb4a652f5f930a909\n\nWell after QQQ put that demand in at 349.06 we now are pushing through that 354.95 supply and resistance area that was incredible resistance all of last week. \n\nWith a break through that and 357.09 the upside target is 361.7 demand\u2026. From there we have a bigger upside target of 369.32 and 371.41. \n\nIn the chance that we retrace tomorrow on QQQ the support would be 357.09 and major support at 354.95\u2026 \n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 354.95 -> 357.09 -> 369.32  \n Demand- 349.06 -> 361.7\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bk51mrbocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b3ccbfbcdab7b03cbaa6f6ef13b37b5d33bc053d\n\nSo what do we have here\u2026 well of the last 5 CPIs this is the highest level the VIX has closed the day before CPI is released\u2026 Actually this is the highest the VIX has closed up (percent wise) since December CPI.\n\nNow what happened on those days? Well on March 14th SPY opened 1.33% green and on December 13th CPI SPY opened 2.8% green\u2026 what does that potentially mean? Well potentially we could get one of our biggest SPY opens in a very long time\u2026 I personally still do not think the risk to reward of swinging anything is worth it though\u2026\n\nI think for myself that in order for SPY to see a bigger green day and open tomorrow we need to see CORE YoY below 5.5% (it has been stuck between 5.5 and 5.6% for the last 4 readings) and we realistically need a surprise print in the 3s\u2026 if we get both of those I do confidently feel that we could see a 1% green open and potentially push for a 2% green day\u2026 that would give us about a 438.14 open and a close near 442.5\u2026\n\nHowever, if CORE remains high and if we some how get a miss on CPI YoY (higher than 4.1%) than I actually especially with CORE missing) would not be surprised to see a flat to red open. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tthd3uocn5b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8ef808b971ed346db57a00caa43b37e930567b72\n\nThe only thing I got right about today was a big VIX move up\u2026 I never would have imagined that SPY would put almost a 1% green day in while the VIX puts it biggest day in since May 4th\u2026 (for instance on May 4th spy closed -0.71%). \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl0oc59pcn5b1.png?width=777&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fd272fd79c21b5d22b3c21489bab16e67a5f5b70\n\nToday was definitely not it for me\u2026 I continued to get slammed today and honestly today felt a lot like Thursday of last week for most of the day\u2026 \n\nAs a technical trader I have said multiple times that I look for SPY, VOLD and VIX to all be in congruence before I take a trade\u2026 today was yet again another time where we found that we were not in congruence\u2026 the biggest issue was definitely the VIX\u2026 watching the VIX pump with SPY is incredibly mind boggling. \n\nOverall small red day and not a big deal as I feel confident I can recover tomorrow as long as technicals move well again\u2026 \n\nIn the end remember not every day will be green\u2026 the days that play well to your strategy is where you should capitalize\u2026 however, days like today that your strategy struggles remember risk management is the key to success. IF you cant manage losers and red days well the green will never outweigh the red. ",

    "selftext": " Let's sift through some hefty financial news that's been making waves. Brace yourselves for the Treasury Statement as of June 12, 2023 - we're staring at a hefty budget deficit of a cool $-240.3 B for May. Ouch! That's steeper than the forecasted hole of $-205.0 B.\n\nWhy should you care about these big-budget deficits? Well, they play a massive role in the supply of Treasury securities. When the deficit rises like it is now, it's akin to opening the floodgates for Treasury notes and bonds. If the demand stays steady but supply spikes, we're talking lower bond prices and a shift to a higher yield landscape.\n\nThis could snowball into hiking the interest rates at which Uncle Sam borrows money. Now, this isn't just a tiny ripple in the pond; it could stir up waves that impact all securities with interest rates tied to them. It could even push us into a higher interest rate scenario for stocks, which is usually a big red flag for bears.\n\nWe also need to keep an eagle eye on Uncle Sam's tax collection. If the tax inflow dwindles and the deficit swells, it's a signal of an economy that's hit a speed bump.\n\nBut here's the silver lining. The market's a treasure trove of opportunities, and every piece of data's a key. The trick is to find the right lock.

    "selftext": "Oracle (ORCL) kicks off a relatively light week for corporate earnings reports, with the enterprise software firm set to disclose its fiscal fourth-quarter results today after close. The stock is currently trading at record highs today, up 5.8% at $116.28 at last glance, and earlier hitting a peak of $117. Analysts, on average, expect ORCL to unveil earnings of $1.58 per share, up 2.6% year-over-year (YoY), on $13.7 billion in revenue (+15.9% YoY). ORCL is expected to report a YoY increase in both profit and revenue for FQ4, which will partly be due to the integration of health information technologies firm Cerner, the acquisition of which closed in November 2022. Over the last 2 years, ORCL has beaten EPS estimates 75% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time. However, in early March they posted mixed FQ3 results and provided an outlook that generally failed to excite investors.\n\nJ.P. Morgan Securities raised its price target to $109 from $93 ahead of the results, and over the weekend, Wolfe Research upgraded the shares to \"outperform from \"peer perform,\" citing tailwinds related to artificial intelligence (AI). Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 23 upward revisions and 0 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 9 upward revisions and 11 downward.\n\nORCL has finished three of its past eight post-earnings sessions higher, including a 10.4% pop last June. This time around, options traders are pricing in a next-day swing of 12.6%, regardless of direction, which is higher than the 5.2% move the stock has averaged over the past two years. \n\nThe Cerner deal (mentioned earlier) from 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, had boosted revenue estimates for ORCL, but also said that it had had a lagging effect on earnings per share. It's expected to have bolstered the company\u2019s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services. For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.\n\nORCL's cloud results will also no doubt be closely watched. ORCL is a distant fourth in the cloud computing market behind Amazon's (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOG), but brokerages such as Guggenheim have highlighted the benefits from such a position.\n\nAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company\u2019s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL\u2019s quarterly performance.\n\nOracle announced on May 18 that it would join the Scheduling Standards Consortium to boost logistical effectiveness. The company's ERP division may have benefited from the move of many sizable SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and rising deal success in a number of industries, including banking and healthcare.\n\nThe strong uptake of Oracle's Dedicated Region Cloud and next-generation Autonomous Database, underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, may have helped the bottom line. Gen2 public cloud architecture is seeing significant momentum for autonomous databases.\n\nIt's increasingly obvious that calls are going to be the play for this one. I'm going to buy the 120c for 3.60 and sell the 125c for 2.30. This means I can get the spread for $130 and potentially make 3.8x gains on this one. Keep in mind tho, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.\n\nEdit: My account has been banned for a single comment I've posted unrelated to /r/wallstreetbets on another subreddit.

    "selftext": "\nAmidst this relentless market storm, have you found yourself caught in the whirlwind of overtrading? You're not alone. These markets are no joke, and it's tempting to react to every twist and turn when it\u2019s bs noise from market media pundits with a business objective of entertainment over empowerment.\n\nTalking strategy and change up the game a bit - Our secret sauce for today? Implied Volatility (IV). Yep, you know it, sounds intimidating, but stick with me here - understanding IV could be your ace in the hole. Great movie, btw if you like old B&Ws\n\nIV is our crystal ball in the world of options. It's like the market's mood ring, indicating how much a security's price might dance around in the future. And guess what? This 'mood ring' can be our best pal in deciding whether to dive into the chaos or to sit one out. \n\nNo, we don't need to be math whizzes to make use of IV. It's all about how we interpret and apply it. Ready to ride the wave instead of being wiped out? Here's your IV game plan for the week ahead:\n\n- **Tuesday, June 13**: The CPI announcement is on the horizon. Here's the deal - before diving into trades, take a pulse check on the IV. This could be our tell-tale sign of how the market might react.\n\n- **Wednesday, June 14**: The PPI-Final Demand is due in the AM, with a Fed Chair Press Conference in the PM. Instead of getting lost in the noise, let's keep an eye on the IV to help us strategize our options play.\n\n- **Thursday, June 15**: It's data release galore with Jobless Claims, Retail Sales, you name it! This is where our friend IV steps in to help us anticipate potential market shifts and make smart plays.\n\n- **Friday, June 16**: It's Quadruple Witching Day. Yep, you read it right. Expect high volatility. But don't sweat it. This is our time to ride the IV wave to potentially make the most out of this roller-coaster day.\n\nHere's the bottom line: trading these markets is like riding a bull - it's unpredictable, it's wild, but if you know how to read the bull, you might just stay on longer. Implied Volatility is that skill to read the bull. \n\nKeep trading smarter",

This past week we saw sideways action in the major indices but several individual stocks still made decent advances. Upcoming announcements this week are the May CPI numbers at 8:30 am Tuesday followed by the FOMC statement and press conference at 2 pm and 2:30 pm on Wednesday, respectively. Long term outlooks for the market are still currently bullish, however, in the short term it may serve well to be cautious with two big announcements coming out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zhv63ortrg5b1.png?width=2273&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f267e4ae6719ea421c69a94b8e59ed5e88e84432\n\nSPY has been advancing nicely over the past few trading days. Last week price was mostly range bound but saw an attempt to go higher on Friday. This price push ran right up to highs from August 2022 and quickly retreated. I would have liked to have seen a stronger close but, it would not e the worst thing if we went sideways here and then broke out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ero8wqourg5b1.png?width=2263&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=23551ca9229771aac109b2d4703fdeef4f483cc2\n\nQQQ is acting similarly to SPY, we saw price run up to a level not seen since April 2022 and then retreat. It would be even more constructive for QQQ to trade sideways here as many mega-cap stocks that make up QQQ have had huge moves and are somewhat extended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j313embvrg5b1.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=426758a00243d0b692696326535e3bbddef8ebf2\n\nARKK is a disruptive technology ETF that is basing around $43.90. The 8, 21, and 50 day EMA are all trending upwards and the 200 day EMA looks like it is starting to curl up as well. There are several tailbars near the breakout point which tells us that there are big sellers there. ARKK will need alot of buying support to be able to push past the selling. If this starts to rise above the base I would look for heavy volume to indicate buying power.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mef2ruvrg5b1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ae99ad517112729b4ff032c58a78d30f59a0e249\n\nARKW is a software ETF and is behaving similarly to ARKK. The tailbars at the base breakout are not as extreme but are still going to require a god amount of buying to push through.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4e043kgwrg5b1.png?width=2271&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=34cf4646dc664b51518cff6cb080217976ee7a64\n\nCLOU is a cloud computing ETF and is approaching a year long downward sloping trendline. Price is a bit extended now so sideways action would be beneficial. However, if a larger market rally occurs, this could lift and have a buy point above Thursdays highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/81rzm6kxrg5b1.png?width=2268&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=794771cb3b0732434000bcdf8bb2407f39878674\n\nHACK is a cybersecurity ETF with a buy price of $49.60. This is a base on base formation where it broke out of a lower base and began to form another base right on top. There was big selling earlier this week and that is something to keep in mind.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zvulpji0sg5b1.png?width=2274&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=59a591cbf00820e41c25206067c3a4a9002dfedb\n\nIJH a mid-cap ETF was on the list last week and broke out. It appears to be bouncing off of its original base formation. If that is the case a buy point would be taking out the weekly highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt709b61sg5b1.png?width=2280&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0cc63cbf818c90360d8423e94b5b56f4cefb5240\n\nKRE is a regional banking ETF that has been hammered by recent bank collapses. It is forming what could be a cup with handle with a buy price of $45.04. Personally, even if this triggers, I would not consider buying this. This ETF is very news driven and can easily take another nose dive if there is bad news.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2oskm1q1sg5b1.png?width=2267&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=877130c8014df622be4917674db9377687238b83\n\nTNA is a small cap ETF which was also on the list last week that broke out. It pushed above the base and 200 day EMA on heavy volume and then pulled back on slightly lower volume. I like how the 200 day EMA is currently supporting price as well. This is also a bounce scenario with a buy taking out the weekly highs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tg3y4b2sg5b1.png?width=2265&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=193b9829d1a13c1df13a2b2cd05f7e5fd77c5022\n\nLastly, we have URA, an ETF that tracks the price of uranium. URA is right at it base and had good buying support on Friday, although I would have liked to have seen more volume. This ETF has had to move quite a bit to get to the base so it may pause here. A buy point could be when price takes out the weekly highs.\n\nThe market has posted some decent gains over the past few weeks. We have also seen broader market participation, meaning that it is not just a select few stocks driving the indices higher. There are many ETFs and individual stocks that forming nice bases with clear buy points. However, this is still a choppy market that can be driven by news. With two big announcements this week, I would not be surprised if we traded sideways until after the news came out. Essentially, be cautious, but also ready to make new buys if the markets begins to push decisively higher.\n\nAs always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment.\n\nIf you have any comments or question on what is discussed in the article or otherwise please feel free to reach out!",

I must extend my sincerest apologies for my prolonged absence. Regrettably, I should not have left everyone in suspense during the collapse of the SVB. I must confess that I was not at my finest during those moments, as I foresaw the subsequent events, reminiscent of Bear Stearns's exit liquidity. However, dwelling on the past serves little purpose, for what has occurred is beyond our control.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Now, many of you may be curious about my presence here. Wasn't I expected to return around 2028-29? Well, my esteemed folks, I have returned earlier because it seems that irrational exuberance has once again seized the collective consciousness. Animal spirits have reemerged from the abyss and permeated Wall Street. Suddenly, everyone is proclaiming, \"The money printer is back on!\" \"We're destined for astronomical gains!\" \"S&P $5000, here we come!\" \"There's bound to be an enormous MAMU ( Mother of all Meltups ) because everyone is bearish,\" and so on.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Therefore, I pondered why not end my hiatus prematurely. Let us debunk the bullish sentiments and remind everyone that interest rates currently stand at 5.25%, not 0%. The government is not distributing stimulus checks; instead, it requests repayment through student loans. The treasury is also looking to replenish Tga this yr by around a trillion and there is this uncertainty over BOJ policy. Thus, instant economic recovery should not be anticipated. It is China, not the USA, that engages the money printer/lowering rates. A considerable portion of the population struggles to afford nutritious food with a solitary job, resorting to multiple employments merely to make ends meet. Virtually anyone earning less than $70,000 per annum lives paycheck to paycheck or dwells in their parents' basement. The current generation faces significant challenges in purchasing homes, among countless other reasons that we shall delve into as this series progresses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEwwwww that was not what I was expecting. I just had to try it guys but wasn't it so cringe?  It didn't feel real and heart to heart. Therefore, expect still a language of an 8yr old from me. So without any further delay let's just get started.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recap :**\n\nSeason 2 sucked! Yeah, I completely agree with you guys. I fucked up. Things got so complicated that I never really tried to update my original script. I was no longer relying on the new coming data but was just looking at things from the perspective as if it was early 2022. But it does not mean we should just move on. First, we need to learn from our mistakes, and yes by we mean I. So therefore let\u2019s first take a quick detour that where did things go wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Oct 2nd week: We called this the bottom and we went max long. And we absolutely nailed it.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nov 2nd week: When SPX hit its target of above $4k I told everyone to sell their tactical positions and start building short positions but not to go all in and short level by level. I was sure that Q1 2023 was going to be a disaster.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Nov 4th week: I was absolutely convinced that after \u201cThanksgiving dinner SPX $4100\u201d markets will start marching towards its $3200 target. Little did I know about the consequences of my decision and what a horrible mistake will that turn out to be.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Last week of December: I was coming back from my vacation and I was so happy that SPX was trading around $3800. I thought this was it the \u201cMinsky moment\u201d shall arrive anytime now. But unfortunately, it never did. So high Vix Jan never happened.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Last week of Jan: I reanalyzed things after SPX again went for $4100 and every time I did my calculations were always pointing to this Q1 disaster that no one really was positioning for.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Feb 19: On my birthday I had to write another newsletter convincing everyone that March was 100% going to be a disaster and SPX shall be trading at $3200 because of this double top pattern. Now that I look back I should\u2019ve known better than that  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\u201cFuck your puts, Fuck your calls  \n>  \n>Hopping like a kangaroo, your inverse portfolio falls\u201d  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>March 3rd week: I wrote my final Newsletter titled S02E08 about the Banking crisis Recession and I came up with the two most basic and simplest theories. Either you crash right now with a bear flag breakdown pattern or use the invalidation case called bear stern exit liquidity ie. crash 9 weeks later with an H&S pattern. I even took some profits off the table coz I forgot to book some in December leg down. But then due to the wrong assessment of financial markets, I deployed them early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Learning from our Mistakes :**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\- Never try to time markets  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Never ever forget the above rule coz even though you time markets with a perfect date it doesn\u2019t do anything. ( Learned it in Season 1 )  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Markets can go sideways for a long time and hence be irrational longer than you can remain insolvent.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Don't underestimate the power of the Federal Reserve.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\\- Start making models and AI algos with ChatGPT you moron.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think I have learned from my mistakes except the last one. Yes, I am a moron but I promise you guys that I will not repeat the above mistakes again. I hope we can build trust from here point on coz trust is all that we have. So let\u2019s analyze things from a new perspective and let\u2019s see what markets are trynna tell us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiment :** \n\n**\"Correlation coefficients on the monthly time frame\"**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn this experiment what we are going to do is first we are going to study the changes that are taking place across the whole asset class on a monthly scale. A lot of beliefs are going to change and people have to get used to these upcoming changes.\n\nSo let\u2019s build a solid foundation from ground zero and see what possible moves can we play depending upon the incoming data. We will play the safest and most logical moves we know in times when we have our doubts about the coming data from not only the Chinese but the US government as well. Now some people like to say they are manipulating it but let\u2019s just go with the data is lagging. The blame and accusations game is for the lawyers, media, politics, and social media. We are here to make a calculated bet. And if it pays off then I guess it was all worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo let\u2019s just deep dive right in.\n\n*-> a. Stock market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUSA :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly Time frame on the right.](https://preview.redd.it/xiiyiv46fc5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=af9971f8ecc1f674951cd271de14c24f42277f89)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe above graph is an SPX-US10y bond yield correlation graph. The green color indicates a +ve while orange indicates a -ve correlation. Higher green lines to the upside mean strongly +ve and higher red lines to the downside means strongly -ve. What +ve means is if SPX goes up then US10y goes up and they are +vely correlated. Always remember if US10y goes up then the price of bonds goes down. Hence stock price up and bond price down is a \u201cNegative correlation\u201d and this correlation is clearly visible on the R.H.S. i.e. monthly graph. There are lots of green colors lines indicating for the past 20yr we were living in this world of \u201cNegative correlation\u201d But then inflation happened and that\u2019s why we are seeing those red lines emerging on the monthly time frame indicating for the past 2yr we have been in \u201cPositive correlation\u201d i.e. stocks and bonds price were selling off or going up together and that is why the usual 60-40 stocks and bonds allocation didn't work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut now as you can see from L.H.S. that things have changed on the weekly time frame. We are going back to the \u201cNegative correlation\u201d where the stock price is inversely proportional to the bond price i.e. bond yields are going up with stock price and vice versa. This correlation got triggered after the \u201cBanking crisis\u201d where we saw a little bit of resteepening of the curve and bond yields just crashed i.e. bond price went up but the stock price went down. It\u2019s one of the chapters of the \u201cRecession playbook\u201d that many investors were looking to deploy myself included in 2H 2023 but things happened so quickly that no one saw it coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A more clear picture of what is happening in the financial world](https://preview.redd.it/ut3ufwajic5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fe7425d59263dd5c3bcb3b12ec07dd9256122c8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo what does this mean for us?\n\nWell in a shorter time frame i.e. weekly and daily we have a \u201cnegative correlation\u201d of the past 20yrs. What this means is people are optimistic right now that inflation is easily heading back down to 2% and that everything is going back to being normal.\n\nAs for a longer time frame i.e. monthly: \u201cWe are still in a strong Positive correlation\u201d of something new that has never happened in our lifetime. So anyone trading after 1998 has never experienced this correlation in his lifetime. Now this is something a biased person would say. An unbiased person would say well if you open trading view CC things have started to slightly turn there on a monthly scale. That means this inflation is going to go away soon so in a year out you could have downside risk to inflation rather than upside risk which we had in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJapan & Germany :\n\nSo now what I did was I tried this not only for SPX but for other Index like FTSE, DAX, and NI225 vs bond yields. The results were a bit meh. Japan was lagging a bit. They still are not convinced and fully 100% onboard Titanic that we are going into another world hence the relation b/w stocks and bonds price is still \"Negatively correlated\" on a monthly scale. Ueda-san still needs more time to be absolutely convinced that this is not just a supply shock inflation but rather a structural inflation. Who knows maybe he is waiting for those red lines to emerge on a monthly scale coz that\u2019s when a \u201cPositive correlation\u201d emerges in stock and bond prices. But tbh all the hard work goes to Abenomics. Things really turned around for Japan in 2012 when Shinzo Abe came back to the office.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in NKY-JP10y](https://preview.redd.it/pm6yts6jaf5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=63aaf5a5fd9bd6e0546022de88f5c0b92a580fcf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for Germany, they are a bit ahead of the USA on weekly and lagging on the monthly time frame and believe in shorter time frames that inflation is about to go away soon. But why is that some of you may wonder? Well imo I think its coz of the 1% drop in the inflation rate from 7.1% to 6.1%. USA hasn't had that yet but it is coming in June CPI which releases in July. A drop from 4.1% to 3.1%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right in DAX-DE10y](https://preview.redd.it/ema33mz1nc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=18d793a4256d4984299eb7f458859a11a866c472)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult:  Inconclusive result.\n\nWe should not believe that inflation is gonna be structural nor should we assume inflation is ending soon which means you guys shouldn\u2019t just go ahead and attach whatever multiple to a stock right now and cause multiple expansions in the index due to few stocks even when the Fed has said they will be H4L. Guys, we still don't know what to make of inflation after that July CPI which releases on Aug. What if after August inflation reaccelerates and goes for double digits by the end of the year or stays elevated high enough after touching 3.1% in July? I mean history has shown us inflation always comes in peaks and it has only happened 1/3 time that inflation straight went down to deflation due to Fed policy error. So if it happens this time around shouldn\u2019t everyone be prepared for it? For those who don't know but in 1921 after the Spanish flu of 1918-1919 we had a Depression with -a 40% crash in DJI. If you are interested in reading more about it then there is only one Ecom book that's actually worth reading and I have already shared it with you guys if you read my past letters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trading view on monthly time frame indicates a reversal a soft landing or deflation coming while those above charts are kinda hinting that inflation is far from over and there could be a risk of second peak. ](https://preview.redd.it/h0txgc82fd5b1.png?width=1916&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=21e4b7e45207593e35e3ded41447875f76cacae9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*->  b. Forex market vs Bond yields.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEurusd-De10y :\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Weekly on the left vs Monthly on the right](https://preview.redd.it/9zk3ov46fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9aa2129c73e7eb528877288c59d3e991496d86f1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow some people would argue that to study Europe you should consider France, Italy, and Spain as well. And don\u2019t get me wrong they are right but you see I am not an expert and hence I don\u2019t wanna overcomplicate stuff. Germany is the largest contributor to the European economy and so if Germany gets f\u2019ed then I am hoping Europe will get f\u2019ed as well. So what do we see here well not much tbh. It\u2019s the same thing earlier in 2022 we saw red lines on monthly and weekly meaning -ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd crashed then De10y went up meaning bonds sold off. But around  SVB we saw a +ve relation between Eurusd and De10y i.e. when Eurusd went up at this time then De10y went up as well meaning bonds still sold (This was a bit strange to me coz generally if there is a deflationary shock to the system it is the dollar that gets the bid regardless of where the system cracks wide open) The monthly also showed some signs that it wants to be +ve related but then got rejected. At this point many people will be bored and be like \u201cWhat are you talking man\u201d \u201cI am more confused\u201d and \u201cJust tell me up or down\u201d Guys just hold your damn horses I will eventually get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/837bge8zid5b1.png?width=1797&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=48b22313ac2a63b8f8620e0411ffb84d9fbb7383\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is btw the daily time frame to express what I just said above. So what next is gonna happen as you can see from the relation graph is we were kinda in a +ve relation but then it's starting to go disappear and go back to being -ve related. Meaning Eurusd could make an H&S and break down while bond yields shoot up i.e. bond prices go down. But let\u2019s not assume anything. It\u2019s still not clear. We need more data.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGbpUsd - Gb10y\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uimr8w66fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1d07d7c65f14780cb15d87b378214bddbb6e6757\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now let's look at Brits. Earlier in 2022 we saw a Pension fund crisis in the UK when Gbpusd fell and so did the bond price i.e. yields went up. Gbp-usd down and Gb10y up is -ve meaning that's why you saw those red lines till October. But since then as you can see from the weekly time frame we went up but we did not go up on monthly meaning the relation should still be very strongly -ve related but some slight signs of +ve relation must have been surely visible recently. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36ui4x3bld5b1.png?width=1791&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2d7a5f201472a5322e293d76df53e2dba2de577a\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can clearly see that -ve relation mostly and some slight signs of +ve but then it's mostly -ve due to strong monthly. Meaning inflation is still a huge problem in the UK and the recent data isn't helping. That's why daily has turned -ve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsdJpy - Jp10y :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/133gr356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5a610a856b43b8f6f13532fc3ac5652670dcdde2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore talking about Japan I would remind you that it's Usd-Jpy and not Jpy-Usd. So be careful not to get confused. So as you can see from here monthly never even went for -ve relation but weekly went for it slightly in 2023 but came back fast. Meaning in 2022 they were strongly +ve due to strong inflation but in 2023 we must have seen some slight signs of -ve relation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wq6c6oevmd5b1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3697119ebdb62b2974b478d1e2bc9e1028b6a45d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is so confusing on the daily time frame. Honestly, all credit goes to the Bank of Japan always fuckin up investors who try to short JGBs and always coming to the rescue of Yen by Fx intervention whenever it looks like the currency pair is gonna fly off. There are so many distortions here but I will try my best. In 2022 we have UsdJpy going up and JP10y flat at 25bps. But in 2023 we saw the YCC band being lifted to 50bps and UsdJpy pair down i.e. -ve related. The few signs of +ve relation returning we saw back in SVB collapse. Here everyone thought the USA was gonna collapse like in 2008. So everyone rushed in for the Yen safe haven and yields collapsed due to the risk of deflation.  Something is not adding up here. So let's just leave it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDXY - Us 10y\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2fowy356fc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f10f62d643d8c56504df1b7a7bf5310f3cfab067\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the only place that actually makes some sense. So as you can clearly see in 2022 we had green lines on both monthly and weekly which makes them +ve related. Meaning if Dxy went up then so did the Us10y. But that relation wanted to change somewhere around Q1 2023. We were heading down as you can clearly see from the weekly time frame but nothing happened and we just reverted back. Overall Dxy-Us10y wanted to be strongly +ve related and it is clearly visible how strong the relationship is as from the monthly time frame. So let\u2019s check the daily time frame to show what I mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r5xybeoxjc5b1.png?width=1483&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e22a7875b298311d16e96733065a51c9f472645\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe relation is just perfect b/w Dxy and Us 10y which show signs of strongly +ve related.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Monthly time frame b\\/w currencies and bond yields.](https://preview.redd.it/fpsy6cqxjc5b1.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9af006387b0c80615490a12dffacac7e5ecea9ec)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know the charts aren't clear but please just bare with me on this one. The top left is your Eurusd, Top right is Gbpusd. The bottom left is your UsdJpy and on the bottom right we have Dxy. Then we have a correlation indicator on the bottom with bond yields i.e. US10y in orange, JP10y in pink, and finally EU10y in blue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult: Only the United States shows signs of very strong +ve Dxy and Us 10y and that is all we care about. We can derive everything from just here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBalance sheets: In own currency vs USD terms\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Japan: Blue, USA: Orange, China: Yellow, Italy: Pink, Germany: Green, UK: Blue](https://preview.redd.it/qgyr0hoxjc5b1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a39fc0f202aa04f60a6c01929ddbe7ad64898ac0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can clearly see till October every CB\u2019s were decreasing their balance sheet due to QT but ECB never said they were doing it in 2022. Also, an interesting thing to note is Japan. It is the only CB that actually decreased its balance sheet faster than anyone till 2020 times and were busy selling foreign reserves as USD was getting stronger and trying to defend the peg at 150. ( After this, I believe they bought $400B in debt again and flooded the global liquidity that Stan D. was talking about) \n\nNow some may argue the USA was the only one which was selling bonds while the rest of the were trying to inflate the debt away by running the economy hot enough. So maybe either this or there is some other mechanism to remove the debt away using fx pair which is out of my pay grade. They do so by making other entities absorb these bonds/mortgages from the CB balance sheet which rose sharply from 2020. Btw I tried testing it out using the JPY pair as well and not just the USD pair. One final thing, USA and JPY balance sheet seems to be running a mirror image so maybe they are working together to stop the recession through global collaboration like the USA exporting some parts of its inflation to Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8nw1coxjc5b1.png?width=1828&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d7ddbc77e7c082b7bc41e571855b32685a268763\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: However you look at it's not pretty clear that inflation is going away in developed countries. Japan is trying its best to import everyone's inflation. Fed, Boj, and Ecb are trying hard to export inflation. My bias of Stagflation still remains but okay there are some signs that from a monthly trading view, we are starting to see reversals i.e. inflation is going away. So let's analyze both perspectives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 1: Deflationary spiral\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 1.1%|or|Down|\n|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|0.x %|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|\\-ve Gdp|\\-ve %|\\> 4%|God knows|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  (Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut soon inflation will go low :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX : will be +ve ( Negative correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: -ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis means that at some point inflation will turn into deflation ( Currently its disinflation) So equity risk premia will blow up. Us yields will go down -> Dxy will shoot up -> Stocks will go down eventually.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime taken :\n\nNormally it takes around 18 bars i.e. 546 days to go from one correlation to another on average and in my opinion it would take around 11 bars i.e. 336 days to see the bottom from here. So expect a crash like President Obama times in 2H 2024.  Now need I remind you this is a general theory and basically what you might have heard from recent interviews of Paul Tudor Jones and Drunckenmiller that they deploy this next yr when the fat pitch arrives. But recently I have seen this \"Inverse them bruh\" trend in the United States so I will not be surprised that it will play out starting July or August this yr considering the similarities to so many headlines we have been having this yr.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2: ReInflation Trade of the Stagflation: ( My bias )\n\nThis trade can also begin early if you have inflation > 4.3% in June or > 3.4% in July. So Top will shift further early.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|S.No|GDP|Inflation|Unemployment|Stock Market|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1.  June|Normal < 2.5%|< 4.1%|Whatever|Up|\n|2.  July|< 1% Q3 Gdp|< 3.2%|Fed|Top|\n|3. August|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\\> 3.2%|or|Down|\n|4. September|< 1% Q3 Gdp|\\> August|Govt wants|Down a lot|\n|5. October|God knows|God knows|\\> 4%|God knows|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, inflation is high :\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: -ve  ( Positively correlated stock and bond price )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then inflation will go higher :\n\nSo, US10y - SPX: will still be -ve ( Still Positively correlated )\n\nDXY - Us 10y: still +ve\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall No change in correlation on a monthly scale. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCase 2a & 2b: What if inflation remains high and stubborn due to govt spending before the election?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 2a) If inflation stays bounded in the range of 4-6% with rates at 5.x% and no recession with the Fed trynna cause financial repression I expect PE to be around 19-20 and all you're gonna up is due to nominal earnings going up 5% / yr. Current est 222 with E increasing 5% per yr you can do the math but in this environment trust me you don't wanna own an index but rather real hard assets like gold or a house. Or you can go pick specific stocks and generate alpha on the company making money or any narratives coz there will always be opportunities even in a bear market. Just look no further than my friend Jensen. He moonshot Nvidia many times inside a vicious bear market of 2001 where the Nasdaq fell -83%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- 2b) Let\u2019s say inflation goes for double digits starting July CPI on August then multiples get compressed to around 14-15 and earnings even with growing 5% nominal let's say 235-240 will be 15X240 min i.e. $3600 i.e. visiting Oct lows. So avoid overpriced tech and any stocks with crazy multiple handles.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, you guys know that I used Stagflation - High Unemployment theory to justify the crash but we never really got the unemployment thing we were looking for. Instead what happened was Stagflation's argument started to fade away. First Gdp started to grow and then inflation just went down w/o any increase in unemployment. This all looks soft landing tbh. But if let's say inflation rises again and be stubborn then Fed may have to do more i.e. take rates to 6% and that would finally break the jobs market alongside Gdp falling. Let's see if it happens or not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how to differentiate b/w these two opposing theories and why am I biased for more inflation?\n\nAns: Japan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ea0u6eoxjc5b1.png?width=1793&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f07961316756e2ef9083ab114f27145f42a95c1f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJapan loves the USA Positive correlation ( here -ve red ) world of stocks and bonds price. If Nikkei moons and rips higher expect an avg 4-6% inflation in the United States. If it is gonna be back to a USA Negative correlation  ( here +ve green ) world then expect USA exceptionalism once we get through the global recession part. Btw these are my own concepts so please correct me if I am wrong. I am a student of macro as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where is the Butterfly effect theory that you promised?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell folks you see it's like a long-shot theory. So basically I saw a P.H.D. level research paper by Riksbank which said that the USA is unaffected by high-interest rates. Nothing is gonna happen but there is one major weakness of the United States i.e. the dollar. Yeah, it's kinda funny though the strongest weapon in their arsenal which makes the USA superpower is actually the Achilles heel of the United States. So you see guys USA is prone to high-interest rates but not the rest of the world. Just look at this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khvkbohkud5b1.jpg?width=1495&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=089fa3dad5ab985e7f667c210cfd583a34eb05af\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis happened bcoz every country except the USA has mostly 2.5yr times where their rate changes even for a fixed rate. Now think for a sec. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat if I come to your house/company tomorrow and tell you \" I am sorry sir/ma'am your fixed rate which you locked in before the hiking cycle began is not really fixed at all\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis above thing happened to one of my friend. So if default rates skyrocket in every country except the United States and recession begins early with inflation falling ( kinda what's happening in Spain ) with headlines like Asia financial crisis or European crisis then currencies of Europe and Asia will get weaker a/g dollar. Safe haven trade will kick in and interest rate differential or any other factor will get thrown out of the window. The only currency which will not is the Yen. In a deflationary crisis, Yen actually becomes stronger but let's for some reason Yen becomes weaker like it is right now I expect Dxy to easily go past 120+ or maybe 150+ like Volcker days. And that my friends is what will put an end to the inflation and cause a huge deflationary shock to the system. Not rates, just Dxy! To combat this the Fed will use CBDC's or some other measure to again save the system and then my friends I don't know what's gonna happen. Who knows maybe this is what is happening right now while everyone is partying like it's a new bull market. Usually, the hints are 2% or more drop in CPI in a month :) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult: Regardless of how you see it guys I am bearish. Now doesn't matter the deflationary shock or reinflation part it is going to be bad for equities. And then one of them is good for gold and the other for bonds. So nothing has really changed for me I am still Camp Stagflation who has hedged himself for a Deflationary outcome by buying bonds. I am still 60% short and 40% long.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position :** \n\n [https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC\\_9\\_L](https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai-SLDVjdnGtkkGfO1jY1WYC_9_L) \n\nSorry, my image limit got hit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts :**\n\nThe real reason why I'm back is because I missed all of you, not because I wanted to smack the sh9t out of bulls. Oh, and I've also fallen back into my old drinking habits again. Now that I recall I never really explained to you guys why I drink so much, so here it goes. My girl left me because I wasn't there for her during tough times. Now she's making a ton of money while I'm stuck trying to move on. She even called me during the SVB days just to check up on me, and we spent a few days together. She is a great person though and I thought maybe I could win her back if I got my act together, which is why I stopped writing. But recently, I found out that she's got a new boyfriend now. So, I'm back to my old ways, writing doomsday posts about the upcoming crisis that no one really sees and attacking the 4 pockets of low liquidity with my bear friends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnjoy the weekend everyone. \n\nSee you guys next week!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegards\n\nGabimaru\n\n( You got a problem with that?

During late July and early August, investors historically begin pulling money out of the market to temporarily cover large purchases before putting money back in markets around late August and early September. \n\nAs a result, UBS stock will likely experience lower liquidity with the rest of the markets around early to mid August, which would be a very good setup for shorting the stock going into earnings. \n\nUBS derives most of its money from emerging markets and uses a top-down model for its business. With India and Poland stock markets relatively flat with recently low volatility, Q2 earnings will not present well with investors.

This has been seen with it making up the random case law a lawyer tried to use. Good luck putting this into any business that values risk management. Once this is regulated and things come back down to Earth the business world is in for a huge awakening because tech is no where near as profitable and revolutionary as many of these companies still claim to be. Look at Tesla\u2019s \u201cself driving\u201d being a complete failure in actually delivering what was promised. It\u2019s recent leaks show insult to injury with its thousands of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d complaints.

This type of \u201cAI\u201d is nothing but a trend, and an arguably unethical one at that. It has the potential to boost productivity substantially, but it\u2019s as close to replacing white collar workers as robots are to replacing blue collar ones due to its lack of high level reasoning.

There's a BP engineer who's a daily user and devotee of Palantir's Foundry platform posted an interesting screenshot. He's genuinely blown away by what the software can do. In his eyes, it's reshaping the business landscape, much like iOS did for smartphones.  \n\nEven in this rocky economy, Foundry is showing its mettle. It's pushing Palantir's U.S. commercial business to impressive heights, hitting a cool $1 billion annual run rate in just six years. That's some Amazon Web Services (AWS) level growth right there.\n\nThe engineer is betting on Foundry to shake things up, and take data and process handling to the next level. More efficiency, more innovation - that's the direction he sees this going.\n\nIn his business unit alone, BP is already running 36 applications on Foundry, and that's just the beginning.

Good reminders that the fight against inflation is not over. \n\n\u2022\tMeanwhile back in the US, the Fed had gone silent this week before the FOMC meeting next week. The market has largely priced in a pause in June. Given the goldilocks economic data in the past month, it is unlikely for the Fed to surprise the market with either more hawkish or dovish languages at the meeting.\n\n\u2022\tOn the other hand, China and Japan are continuing their loose credit policies as these countries worry more about deflation rather than inflation.\n\n\u2022\tAs for liquidity, we know TGA will be refilled, and we know the Fed is on track with QT, and both are bad for the market, so RRP is the most important thing to watch here.

Some retailers have observed weakness in discretionary categories, suggesting a potential consumer pullback.\n3. Tight labor markets: Labor shortages persist due to early retirements and reduced immigration during the pandemic.

Investor sentiment certainly support a higher PE multiple for now. However, given a lot of headwinds ahead especially short term liquidity drain, possibility of more Fed hikes, and further economic slowdown, I am being a little cautious and not changing my target just yet.\n\nLight blue box is where we are today. If we use 10-yr average forward PE ratio (17.3X), 3980 is a more appropriate level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lwcwpe8vde5b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9fd34816ba5a5e396fe16b4fb3119d4aa754670a\n\nI have been talking about the comeback of small caps if the current \"Goldilocks\" situation persists, characterized by a resilient economy and consumers.

    "selftext": "**INTRO**\n\n \n\nListen, I am aware that half of the people here are genuine gambling addicts, convincing themselves that 0dtes are somehow different from hitting the bookies. I also understand that the average WSB user recoils at the mere suggestion of \"long-term investing.\" However, I hope to convince you that, just this once, an opportunity might lie on the Euronext instead of the NYSE, even though it may be considered a cardinal sin by many, perhaps even greater than buying and holding index funds.\n\n**FYI:** This is my first DD POST, so please excuse the formatting and shit grammar. To clarify my position, I have been holding a significant number of shares of BESI for the past five years. Recently, I sold about half of my position to secure profits as I reassess my short and long-term thesis. \n\n**TL;DR:** BESI is a semiconductor stock in the Netherlands that specializes in die attach and assembly. It shows great potential for the future, with an extremely bullish long-term outlook, while possibly being bearish in the short term as we approach the earnings report on July 27th.\n\n**What is BESI?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fm7c8owrwd5b1.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2e8885b9956f125d9ae20c9a13853fe2e25a765f\n\nTo begin, let's understand what BESI actually does. BESI is a manufacturer of semiconductor assembly and packaging equipment. In simpler terms, they produce machines used to make various types of chips found in your tech devices. They operate in a wide range of industries, including electronics, mobile internet, cloud servers, computing, automotive, industrial, LED, and solar energy. Mobile technology is their primary focus.\n\nHeadquartered in the Netherlands, BESI has manufacturing locations across Asia, Europe, and the US. They also plan to expand further into Vietnam, following the trend of semiconductor manufacturing shifting away from China after a decline in productivity due to COVID-19. \n\nBESI specializes in die attach, packaging, and plating, which are crucial aspects of semiconductor manufacturing. Currently, BESI is the leading company in the die attach market, as shown below.\n\n[Besi has a 40&#37; market share of the Die Attach market and is their main profit maker ](https://preview.redd.it/pvkx0drtwd5b1.png?width=1269&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3d6a4a32fa895e73bdf556011e8f0ef15d78e9e9)\n\nBESI's customers include some of the world's largest tech companies and since they have such a large market share if you look under the hood of your mobile devices, graphics cards, and hell even actually under the hood of your Car then you'll find at least some semiconductors, if not a majority, have in some part been produced via one of Besi's many Machines that they manufacture.   \n\n\n(speculation warning)  \nIt is worth noting that in the semiconductor industry, large and important customers often deal through subcontractors to maintain secrecy and mitigate the risk of corporate espionage. During investor presentations, and actual conversations I have personally had with Besi personnel at these presentations they mention names like Apple and Nvidia, and even listed Foxconn as a subcontractor, providing further evidence to support the theory that Apple is also a customer. \n\n[A List of their confirmed customers as well as their subcontractors so you can speculate yourself  ](https://preview.redd.it/t0qr8d60xd5b1.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=f07d7f3640d4ea1e9941b6543e4ea02e211f1eac)\n\n**MACRO**\n\nDie attach is currently BESI's core business and primary profit driver. However, industry forecasts suggest that 2023 will be a slower year for semiconductor companies, which could result in an overall decrease in profits. Nonetheless, future projections indicate that around 2024, the next cycle of growth is expected to begin. .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwpmlee3xd5b1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cde187f45e18d6c2e346186e90761f1538bebf2\n\nIf you've been following developments in the semiconductor industry, you've likely come across the concept of hybrid bonding. Almost every semiconductor company is heavily investing in this technology as the next major advancement. BESI is also focusing on hybrid bonding and has started producing hybrid bonding machines. As the customer base for hybrid bonding grows, BESI can expect an increase in orders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Besi Already starting to get into HB machine production, poised to grow signicantly if they do well](https://preview.redd.it/kixec204xd5b1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=eebd3b4d2a35b038d654b76d2680ada8076fb1e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMD has already started planning to incorporate HB in several of their chiplines, there is real potential for a large customer base here if BESI nails this](https://preview.redd.it/479n19o4xd5b1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=963356e04701300a0ab447e445f6bbf5dbc5c572)\n\n AMD, for example, has already begun planning to incorporate hybrid bonding in several of their chip lines. This presents a significant opportunity for BESI to expand its customer base. Additionally, AMD has been announcing more products that require advanced process steps and a higher number of die placements in their EPYC line of chips. This trend indicates that as chips become more advanced, companies like BESI stand to profit further. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykp2qmjcxd5b1.png?width=1278&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb23035a25d57e0a7f2374cc6e3b8f9ff021bd4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Their Numbers**\n\nTo start the Balance sheet numbers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v67ic5hmxd5b1.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d536b9187f056935703a774496d19bcdff49928f\n\nLet's delve further into BESI's balance sheet numbers. As shown, BESI has captured a significant portion of the die attach market, which has been steadily growing. Although other aspects of their business have been fluctuating, they still maintain a considerable market share in the various fields they serve.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqt9nzhoxd5b1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c045ea82bf795c338671b57d39224a62a994cee9\n\nOver the years, BESI has demonstrated solid profit efficacy and margin while remaining relatively cost-effective to run, indicating strong financial performance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lavw0aapxd5b1.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=991fcc5501c733e9dfcdb7e423fcdfcedbc0aeca\n\nBESI boasts a substantial cash reserve that far exceeds their debt, providing them with a robust liquidity base.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pxmwwr6qxd5b1.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=09b6e40fd69d23797acf52e37cc4e4de808258ef\n\nWhats also important to note that this october BESI is finishing its 300 Million euro Share buyback program, They purchased \\~3.5 million shares already through may-23 for \u20ac 222.1 million.\n\n**Aren't they near ATH right now after a huge bull run?**\n\nYou might be wondering if BESI is currently trading near its all-time high (ATH) after experiencing a significant bull run. Indeed, BESI has performed remarkably well since the March 2020 crash. Just recently, the stock reached an ATH of 104 euros per share but subsequently fell to 94 euros. This drop is precisely why I am presenting this DD now, as I expect it to continue falling at least by a few euro further. Analysts also have forecasted a slowdown in semiconductor market growth for 2023, as the largest spenders in the industry reduce their total expenses. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[forecasting a slow in growth in the semiconductor market](https://preview.redd.it/56ghuewqxd5b1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2cedf5f2d50a091d7d3be542f51386039a6c81d3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n It's crucial to recognize that BESI operates as a cyclical company. Typically, the third and fourth quarters witness a surge in orders as companies manufacture new products for release. On the other hand, the first and second quarters experience a lower influx of orders. \n\n**My Thesis:**\n\nConsidering all the factors discussed, I anticipate that BESI will post mediocre to average earnings on July 27th, and I am even slightly bearish in the short term leading up to the earnings release. Consequently, I have adjusted my position to hold only about half of my original shares in the past few weeks. If BESI continues to decline in the coming weeks, my plan is to purchase more shares, bringing my holdings back to approximately 75% of my original position.\n\nHowever, in the long term, BESI is well-positioned to continue dominating the die attach market. As semiconductor chips become more advanced, BESI stands to profit even more. Additionally, the growth of hybrid bonding and advanced placement technologies presents further opportunities. BESI already has machines in development for both areas.\n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts on this analysis as well.",

    "selftext": "\n\nWhy the \u201crecession\u201d seems to not be happening.. in most places.\n\nBasically, it comes down to secular growth trends and money flow. Despite the fact that there are high interest rates, slowing retail spending, layoffs, high debt, low cash reserves- the sky appears to not be falling. It will however, happen in some places. \n\nRight now, there are industries, cities, and technologies that are going to suffer, but there are also ones that will do well. There are cities, for example, that are ripe for a housing crash (San Francisco, Phoenix, Nashville). There are industries and companies who, if they don\u2019t keep up with AI, won\u2019t make it. The companies who have been driving AI- MSFT, NVDA, AAPL, AMZN, ADBE, etc, have all done well so far in 2023. The movement and velocity of money, while slowing down in the macro sense, still hasn\u2019t broadly affected companies with strong cash positions and competitive moats. \n\nAll of it has the same common thread- some areas will suffer and some areas will boom. We find these by evaluating leadership, policy, and catalysts for growth. \n\nThings can come to a grinding halt if the consumer is in such a tight spot that money stops flowing- however that is also not really happening yet, and it would seem as if the federal reserve doesn\u2019t truly want to get to that point. Political climates could change and influence this, but that probably won\u2019t happen until the next presidential election. Technically, if year over year GDP growth starts to go negative, then we are in a recession. Even still, there will be opportunities that arise out of that, like a cooled down real estate market, and maybe some stocks at discounted valuations. Right now, there are definitely stocks that have been ignored compared to the AI rally, and may be ripe for buying. \n\nTypically my basic initial checklist looks like this:\nIs this company profitable?\nIs it run well?\nDoes the leadership have a vision and good follow-through? \nDoes it have a strong cash position? \nDoes it have a competitive moat? \nAm I buying a great company at a fair price?\nWhat are the catalysts for future growth?\n\nThere are many more factors to take into account but this is a good place to start. You can modify and apply these principles to real estate as well.",

Well yesterday markets called for a pump so I had to be bullish for today\u2026 there is a very different time frame to have on some of these posts\u2026 that $400 target is a 30-45dte target\u2026 however, I still have overnight and intraweek moves that may inverse that\u2026 This market is ruthless and can not make its mind up for more than a minute sometimes\u2026\n\nWith that being said I am bearish for Monday\u2026 based on todays technicals\u2026 we will get to that but lets talk about CPI and FOMC first\u2026 \n\n**EVENT CALENDER** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vdvc1xsra25b1.png?width=877&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=aa8186d8ece9e1b544ada3aa3b39a6b4ec6a4d91\n\n**CPI/ FOMC**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pb5ceqdsa25b1.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=8fafeb023689f2861cd32839218d29dbf886f007\n\nI am waiting on bloomberg terminal numbers right now\u2026 hoping to get them this weekend (if anyone has access DM me\u2026 if not I gotta wait on one of my other sources)\u2026 but the way im seeing it right now is that cleveland fed nowcast and consensus are all pretty much spot on\u2026 the biggest thing to note here is that CPI is calling for a print in the 4s\u2026 we even if all goes well could see a print in the 3s! that would be wild to be honest\u2026 also note for next month nowcast is already calling for a 3.3% CPI print!\n\nSo the question is how do we trade this and what is the market going to do? Well I would NOT trade this at all\u2026 why? Simple\u2026 its been months since we have had a decent reaction that would make the risk to reward of the payout worth it\u2026\n\nNow how will the market react? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yrpc2wqsa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=263f9f2bb8a15fdd477af504f928a9ac9e6c9e1d\n\nAs you can see here the last month things have been very up and down\u2026 but as of current time of writing this\u2026 the markets see the highest odds of a PAUSE at this meeting next week\u2026 now this is where I still think the markets have it wrong\u2026 there has been ZERO indication for JPOW about a pause\u2026 pretty much every time JPOW himself has actually spoken he has ALWAYS said he is going to do a 25bps hike and that there is NO RATE CUTS this year\u2026 now this is really where I think markets have it all wrong\u2026\n\nThe markets were pricing in 75bps of cuts by EOY\u2026 Impressively\u2026 the markets now have the highest odds of NO RATE CUTS by end of year.. I do think the markets finally have this correct\u2026 however, while the odds may be correct now\u2026. I do not see the markets reacting correctly\u2026 \n\nI do think if JPOW hikes 25bps on Wednesday (which is highly probable in my opinion) that we will see a negative reaction to that\u2026 but I do see that as a likely call entry opportunity whenever that sell off stops\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlrqya6ta25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fe30468d1a5f8a00f101375ed9ec800c07663c0a\n\nWell after putting that 426.6 demand in we have now immediately turned around and put a new supply in at 429.13\u2026 however, do you see the issue with it? We are imbalanced.. why? Simply because today we are going to close higher than where the supply is put in\u2026 that means markets will need to come back down OR immediately turn around and make a new demand Monday\u2026 \n\nOne interesting thing is that since pretty much April 26th SPY has not broken through a previous demand after establishing a supply\u2026 what do I mean\u2026 I mean lets take that 410.2 demand\u2026 after markets put that in and put in a new supply (was around 420) the markets held that 420.1 demand and did not close below it\u2026 we have been stair stacking (bullishly) new demands since 404 area. \n\nHowever with 3 supplies here at this 428-430 area now this has become one extremely strong resistance\u2026 \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w0h22ylta25b1.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9999d3f0e05e2cab71328c9f02b94ba5570f6be\n\nThere is actually no changes to the weekly time frame here\u2026 we closed over previous supply and did not put in a new supply\u2026 DMI remains overbought and SPY remains ready to put in a new supply on any red week\u2026 \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le6b011ua25b1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fe3b4eb700fb2e2572fb6e1f7a080508ee4c522f\n\nSPY daily here remains in this black bull channel that it has been in since May 23rd\u2026 we also have the bigger broad red/blue bull channel since March 8th\u2026\n\nNow this is a CLASSIC bearish reversal pattern with this evening doji star closure\u2026 we also once again failed to close over 430.. We did close higher than the august 16th closure but we did not close over 430 yet again\u2026 this would be 4 failed rejections in the last 5 trading days from closing over 430. \n\nI would not be surprised to see price come back down to 426.5 demand (support) or perhaps 428 supply on Monday\u2026 however, I do forsee it still being bullish\u2026 honestly until this black bull channel is broken and really until we close under the daily 20ema this remains bullish and dips remain call opportunities\u2026 \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8l2cfofua25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4dc43cc0eba6ffe5993d38aaea51f2c07600a889\n\nI think this weekly chart clearly shows the overall trend and shows everything the best\u2026 \n\nHere you can see since the beginning of march we have been in this blue bull channel. Until SPY breaks under that weekly support (419 for next week) as you can see by the wicks this remains a buy the dip market\u2026 we also have a large red/ blue rising wedge that we have been trading within since middle of September\u2026 that resistance sits at 436.1 for next week. \n\nSPY WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 416.08 -> 427.35 -> 453.23  \n Demand- 411.57 -> 381.74  \n Support- 428.2 -> 422.1 -> 418.6  \n Resistance- 430 -> 436.9 -> 444.3\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uxbf4bwua25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=e9edcf40580e29d2541b7078b372895ca5286e40\n\nNot surprisingly here futures followed suit of SPY and also put in a new supply at 4298. We actually are imbalanced on futures which does not usually happen. So that will be interesting to watch get sorted out over next week.. as of right now futes minimally needs to close under 4299 in order to be balanced. \n\n4312 is the supply and resistance from the august high and we once again failed to close over that level\u2026 it is safe to assume for now 4312 is strong resistance. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzs6k4eva25b1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a811d49b20225642ea0fd966735623df11337137\n\nNo changes to futures weekly supply and demand\u2026 we are attempting to make 4284 into a support, however, it is not set up to turn it into a demand which would be incredible bullish. \n\nNOTE ON FUTURES- on tradingview (where I primarily chart) the contracts rolled over night and when that happens the charting is always messed up for about a week because there was about a 100pt gap up due to that\u2026 there is a way to adjust for contracts but none of my levels are adjusted for that so it would throw everything off\u2026 for now I wont be including Futes daily or weekly price action until things normalize some\u2026 I will not include support/ resistance either as it is incorrect.\n\nFUTURES WEEKLY LEVELS-  \n Supply weekly- 4193 -> 4284 -> 4540  \n Supply daily- 4240 -> 4292 -> 4298 -> 4312  \n Demand weekly- 4130 -> 3921  \n Demand daily- 4273 -> 4188\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7f36vzwva25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=beb97a78ce8b16f7c9e64b31e456912c7c6629e2\n\nNow I said yesterday I was VERY bullish on QQQ and that I was looking for 358-361\u2026 we ended up coming super close at open with hitting 357.66 but we did come up and retest that 357.09 supply and once again failed to break through and close over that level\u2026 we actually have really turned 354.95 supply into a major resistance here with this being the 5th rejection in 6 days at this level\u2026 \n\nNow we did put in a new demand at 349.06 today\u2026 however, I will say I am VERY bearish on QQQ for Monday\u2026 \n\nI would not be surprised at all to see QQQ come back down to at least 351 on Monday\u2026 If you look at QQQ objectively since 5/26 it has been holding within a 347.93 to 357.09 range for 10 closes in a row now\u2026 this right now is our consolidation period/ range\u2026 \n\nQQQ likely could drop down to 350-351 Monday and could possibly put in a new supply at 354.5 area.. if it did that then we absolutely would look for 348-349 to bounce us and look to long it back to 357. However, IF we can retrace to 349-351 and not put in a new supply I would actually be even more bullish and would look for 361.7 demand to be taken out next week. \n\nNow daily DMI is waving up which is bullish and we did hold the daily 8ema today\u2026 however, that massive evening doji star bearish reversal candle certainly should result in a drop\u2026 daily also broke extreme bull momentum\u2026 \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vub7bdwa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7866d11220bd8648c87cf114d36a581a119cfd70\n\nNow on QQQ weekly here this is looking far more bearish\u2026 we just put in a double top with back to back dojis with a weekly supply at 354.65. This is our first supply since the first week of May. \n\nNow only that but we also have a weekly DMI wave down forming here on QQQ. I will say though that despite this bearish set up that we have here\u2026 QQQ weekly remains in extreme bull momentum (despite the daily losing it) which means the weekly 8ema likely will be support on any retrace\u2026 that weekly 8ema should sit somewhere near 340 next week. Impressively QQQ weekly has NOT broken through the 8ema since the first week of may (5 weeks in a row) and we have not closed under the weekly 8ema since the week of March 6th. \n\nAs you can see we are working on a yellow rising wedge since the week of December 12th. \n\nFor me we have that 330.67 supply to keep an eye on next week\u2026 However, that would not only break the weekly 8ema but would also break the 6 month long rising wedge support\u2026 I do not think QQQ has seen the weakness and top to do that\u2026 likely weekly support will sit at 337.7 at the lowest next week but I will look for 339-340 to be a bounce point. \n\nOn the upside if we immediately bounce higher next week we actually could turn this weekly 354.65 supply immediately into a demand which would be incredibly bullish. Upside resistance of the wedge sits at 359.94 and we have a weekly supply at 361.85 to keep an eye on. \n\nQQQ WEEKLY LEVELS  \n Supply- 330.67 -> 354.65 -> 361.85  \n Demand- 322.47 -> 316.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1g1n41wwa25b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a4a790f94d48dd3ae4e65e39904f59f4c7b977de\n\nEven though it looked like the VIX would never recover and was just going to keep falling and falling and falling\u2026. We actually did it\u2026 we actually put in a new daily demand (support) on the VIX at 13.62! \n\nThis is our first demand the VIX has put in since May 18th\u2026 \n\nFun fact about the VIX and putting in Demands (taking the move from low to high of when VIX puts in a demand till its next supply)\u2026  \n March 6th= VIX +65.6%, SPY -6.5%  \n March 14th= VIX +34.1%, SPY -2.5%  \n March 21st= VIX +16.9%, SPY -2.3%  \n April 4th= VIX +8.1%, SPY -1.42%  \n April 6th= VIX +9%, **SPY +0.71%**  \n April 18th= VIX +20%, SPY -2.9%  \n May 1st= VIX +37.2%, SPY -3.3%  \n May 11th= VIX +9.6%, SPY -0.6%  \n May 18th= VIX +29.9%, SPY -2.6%\n\nThis is becoming my new favorite thing to do\u2026 What does this show? \n\nOn average over the last 9 times the VIX has put a new demand (support) in it has bounced 25.6% and SPY has fallen -2.38%. There is one time in April though where SPY did randomly push higher despite the VIX pushing up 9%... \n\nBut what does this mean? Well this means that if this plays out like normal the VIX will see around $17 and SPY could drop to $421.7 before we put a new supply in on the VIX (I will calculate that out once that happens). \n\nNow thre is always the chance with low daily volatility and daily/ weekly extreme bear momentum that we do not do that and immediately turn around and put a new supply in\u2026 but I will say since November there has not been a time we have seen with the supply indicator this low that we have immediately turned around a put a new supply in\u2026\n\nThe highest probability is that we see a bounce here on the VIX and drop on SPY\u2026 we also broke the 12 day long bear channel today\u2026 the next step is for bears to close VIX over the daily 8ema and this should breakout. \n\nNext week with CPI and FOMC truly could be really spicy\u2026 \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lim9sh9ya25b1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=7dc2cbd9cbdb84cc9d694b77aedb1789b268d216\n\nWell I wasn\u2019t supposed to be trading today\u2026 but ended up getting home earlier than expected and was able to get some solid trading in today. Today was a refreshing breath of air after getting absolutely wrecked yesterday\u2026 today was perfect trading and felt perfect to trade, however, after about 145 I will say that we once again say internals not matching correctly\u2026 \n\nOverall I failed to reach my weekly profit goal but on an extremely positive note here I was able to break the curse of Fridays by putting in a green day (even after realizing my tsla loss). \n\nThis close out as a nice green week and I am not too upset with the results especially after how brutal yesterday was. \n\nI have now been green for the last 10 weeks in a row which is one week shorter than my longest weekly streak in 2022! \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and I will see you guys next week!

In my opinion this is a 100% small penis 4-bagger and I\u2019m sharing it like Moses with acid tabs.\n\nHere\u2019s the 4-point DD for you with ADHD:\n\n* It\u2019s Robinhood, but actually good for you\n* The company is in great shape\n* Permabears and bulls have reasons to love it\n* The brand is (let me explain) the next JPMorgan Chase\n\n# Thesis\n\n**Product**\n\n* SoFi is actually a great product. Is it the BEST? Fuck no. But it\u2019s like the goldilocks/Anna Kendrick of all apps. The Friday night reliable.\n* The company is going for this generation\u2019s next big bank. It is high-interest, chartered (4.3% APY) and offers everything you need under the sun.\n* The whole company\u2019s theme is: \u201cGet your money right.\u201d They want to be the one-stop shop for all your MONEY needs and they do it with a bank teller smile.\n* SoFi will ride or DIE with you. Student loan refi, your job\u2019s direct deposit, a loan for that cock ring, a credit card for that solo trip to Thailand, a HELOC for that YOLO stock play. It goes on and on.\n* They have consumers in mind, and not in a fake old lady See\u2019s Candy kind of way. For example: if you lose your job and can\u2019t pay your student debt, they will pause your payments and help you find a job. No joke. Look beyond the news and you\u2019ll see people are over the moon about their relationship with SoFi.\n* They have a few bad spots (dogshit trading platform and ETFs that never move), but they are trying so fucking hard. I could go on and on, but it\u2019s 5:49am (couldn\u2019t sleep, came up with this post in a fever dream) and I have a ton more to write.\n* They also have Galileo and Technisys, which are like new PVC pipes for the financial system. I\u2019m literally too smoothbrained to explain this, all you need to know is there is a lot of real interest from banks and companies to use these products. /r/sofistock has nerds who can explain this to you.\n\n**Financials**\n\n* Okay here comes the boring stuff, so skip this if you don\u2019t care about amateur due diligence.\n* Remember when banks used to pay good interest, then you realized they were pocketing it all? People are realizing and going to SoFi. When the bank crisis happened and everyone was moving their money out, SoFi actually GAINED deposits. The company has said they are on-track to add $2B each quarter, and management are known to low-ball their estimates. NINETY PERCENT of their customers use direct deposit for their premium membership SoFi Plus, which will only accelerate the trend. You know how hard it is to change banks with direct deposit. Sticky as shit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jht14744q15b1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=fa503be4e6971d54e63f398b39d86b19f381aed5\nh/t /u/SnipahShot for the graphic\n\n* SoFi has EIGHT fucking quarters of consecutive revenue growth, is EBITDA profitable (whatever that\u2019s worth to you), and is projected to be GAAP profitable by Q4. I think there\u2019s an outside chance this happens in Q3. Dig into it more if you want to Burry it [https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc\\_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation\\_.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2023/q1/Q1-23-Investor-Presentation_.pdf)\n* SoFi is growing WHILE student loans have been paused. Name a better miracle. They replaced it by diversifying their business in financial services (e.g. the shit I mentioned earlier) and other loans.\n* While most banks have been selling their loan books at a loss to manage higher interest rates, SoFi have been keeping theirs to maturity and getting a higher return. There is a lot of debate into this, especially around how they calculate mark to market, so again do your own DD about this.\n* By the way: \u201cthere are many reasons insiders sell a stock, but only one reason to buy.\u201d The CEO Anthony Noto is eating pork and beans like me buying the stock like CRAZY. I mean just look at this degeneracy. He knows he has a chance to become the next billionaire bank CEO Jamie Dimon and has purchased back $13.6m dollars worth of shares (1/5 of his total comp so far lmfao).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/33ihxpf5q15b1.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3786cf8c33f92318fd69d6a4ef63d2e95b3cfc61\n\n**Macro**\n\n* Big picture time. Full disclosure, I\u2019m a permabear. I literally have the worst outlook on things and I metaphorically killed my therapist with my doom and gloom. This country is so levered up to the tits it\u2019s just one gentle breeze away from collapsing.\n* But you know who always gets paid? By hook and crook, the banks will get what they\u2019re owed. If not we are all fucked and/or there will be a bailout. If everything is going to shit, banks are the least dogshit shit. Would you rather buy a stock with a tremendous amount of debt super dependent on consumer spending, or something that will make money in a depression?\n* I said this was a stock for everyone. For the permabulls, everything is fine and SoFi is growing its metrics like a rocket ship. What is there to lose? The management team has signaled good outlooks and the stock price has gone up consecutively since June 1st.\n* For value investors, this stock is still near book value. Most bank stocks are, but considering its fair value by Morningstar ($16) or PT by well-known analysts ($8-12) there are still some mArGiN oF sAfEtY\n* Growthies, this is a tech stock BABY. They are the AWS of finance! They use tech to analyze loan risk. They have AIAIAIAI in a chat bot! Upside everywhere\n* Oh and by the way, $SOFI is not correlated with its peers. Look at $LC $UPST and other fintech companies in the sector. In my mind it\u2019s becoming the Nubank of America.\n* The Fed is expected to \u201cskip\u201d rate hikes next week. Long term that means APY is probably plateauing and on a downward trajectory. But if you know SoFi has done nothing but good and given you the best interest rate, why move?\n\n**Brand**\n\n* Okay let\u2019s start with them suing the government for pausing student loans. The CEO has addressed this multiple times: they support student loan FORGIVENESS, but when it comes to PAUSING payments for borrowers who don\u2019t qualify, they thought the 3rd year was excessive. Yes they shit the bed bad for that, but they\u2019ll recover.\n* Aside from the revenue, a big reason they did this is because the CEO has integrity. Like too much integrity to let this go for shareholders. Anthony Noto grew up working class, graduated from West Point, and rose through the ranks in the finance world. Imagine if Charlie from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was real and became a banking god.\n* His track record is insane. CFO for the NFL during record growth. COO for Twitter where he was putting out garbage fires. He knows how to run shit, and now he\u2019s back in finance after SoFi booted the last CEO for being pervy.\n* One downside, he is boring as shit. He won\u2019t talk about who\u2019s a pedo, how Soros is evil or some other drama. He only talks about banking and banking accessories I tell you what. Bank Hill\n* Look at his Twitter Likes. [https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes](https://twitter.com/anthonynoto/likes) He knows something is brewing, and he gets a big payday if the stock hits $45.\n* Back to the company. At a recent fintech conference hosted by Piper Sandler, Noto announced that SoFi has a Net Promoter Score (how much people like the brand) of 80 for its loan business. For context, American Express has 52. The math says SoFi is literally 54% better.\n* Maybe part of the reason is because they have the naming rights to a football stadium in Los Angeles. One where little kids go to see Taylor Swift and grown ass men watch other grown ass men smack into one another. Where it\u2019s mentioned all the time for being state of the art and environmentally friendly in the largest entertainment market. WHERE THEY WILL HOST MULTIPLE WORLD CUP GAMES AND OLYMPIC SPORTS.\n* I mentioned the SPAC bagholders. They still exist and have been pounding nonstop about the stock all the way down. There are some stonk flashbacks here that are about to explode.\n\n# BUT BUT BUT\u2026\n\n* iTs pRiCeD iN \u2013 Wall Street is only getting a taste of this dildo. Once the annual shareholder meeting comes along next week and estimates come in better than expected on earnings, this next door 2 turns into a 10.\n* Student loans defaults are coming, you stupid fuck \u2013 You think the bank will let you go to Disneyland once they start asking for their money? They will garnish wages and withhold taxes on you plebs. Grow up or move to Vietnam. Or, just maybe, the stock goes up and you use the profits to pay off the ball and chain?\n* This is literally your first time posting to WSB \u2013 Yes, I\u2019m a fucking worm lurking in the shadows. This will be the one and only thesis I put out.\n* Wedbush has a PT of $3, this thing is going down \u2013 Go ahead and listen to David Chiaverini, who has a success rating of 35% and has no skin in the game [https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini](https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/david-chiaverini) Or me, who\u2019s about to mortgage everything because he see\u2019s asymmetric risk.\n* Why post now? \u2013 I genuinely think this will get re-rated with a soft tech valuation of $32, and we\u2019re at the cusp of it happening.\n* What will change the price \u2013 Market realization, better than expected results coming soon, major deals announced, new product releases planned this year. Literally yesterday they announced \u201cSoFi at Work\u201d, a program to allow employers to help contribute to student loan payments.\n\n# In Conclusion\n\nTake this however you want, go fuck yourself etc. If you miss the boat, DM me to sign up for a new SoFi account and get up to $275 back when you set up direct deposit.\n\nAgain I cannot stress this enough, this is not financial advice and please do your own research.\n\n\n*EDIT: Corrected some stats and added credit for deposit graphic.*",

I've bounced around multiple platforms in my time, TD, Fidelity, etc but I've been using RH lately due to ease of use on my cell phone so I can track values pretty easily. Their values seem to update quickly, there doesn't seem to be a lag in option values and underlying values like on other platforms. Most of my trading is done in the morning, which is an issue in some other platforms when markets open. \n\nOther than the inability to sell short which is already very risky, what makes RH a bad investment platform? I haven't seemed to have any issues with them in terms of withdrawing money, depositing money, purchasing assets in a timely manner, etc. \n\nI've seen this question asked multiple times on this forum and the only answers people seem to provide is \"just wait you'll get screwed over\"..

The stock market has been relatively quiet this week, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all trading within a narrow range. This comes after the debt ceiling was raised and no major economic data was released this week. Former President Donald Trump has been indicted on seven federal criminal counts related to classified documents he kept at his Mar-a-Lago home. He will appear in court on Tuesday. This is the second criminal indictment for Trump, who has maintained his innocence in both cases. General Motors has partnered with Tesla to allow GM owners to use Tesla's Supercharger network. This is similar to a partnership that Tesla recently struck with Ford. The partnerships are a step towards a unified charging standard for electric vehicles in the United States. The American consumer is still spending, which has helped to offset some of the economic headwinds. However, there are still concerns about a recession. JPMorgan's global market strategist, Marko Kolanovic, believes that the U.S. and global economies are still on solid ground and that fears of a recession are overblown.\n\nI don't post these types of briefings daily, but I could? If you guys want more posts like this on the daily, be sure to upvote and follow me. It helps me gauge interest.\n\n**Watchlist**\n\n**M**U - Micron came down to test support around $64 and jumped off this level yesterday. This $64 level acted as significant resistance over the past year and now should act as support for the stock.\n\n**VET** - This nat gas stock is coming up to test resistance around $12.20 which is where shares topped out in May. The $12.20 resistance level coincides with the stock 50 daily MA which should provide additional resistance.\n\n**BA** - Boeing is coming up to test resistance around $219 which is where shares had topped out in February and April. The stock is also nearly overbought according to RSI which should help push shares lower.\n\n**BIDU** - Double inside bar setup on the daily time frame. A break below 133.10, I'd look for 132.53 as the first target, next targets I'd have is 132, 131, 130.52, and under 130.25.",

The 10-year  average over the same timeframe is 1,624 fires and 254,429 hectares  burned.\n\nThe  department said it is unusual to have blazes across most of the country  this early in the wildfire season, and that Canada could pass the annual  record for burned area if the current rate of fire activity continues.\n\n**British Columbia, Quebec and Alberta** produced 81% of Canada's softwood lumber in 2020.

    "selftext": "Hey fellow apes of r/wallstreetbets, I come bearing some exciting news about our beloved NVDA stock! Now, before you jump into a frenzy, hear me out. I know it might sound counterintuitive, but having an overvalued stock with an extremely high P/E ratio could actually be a fantastic opportunity for us.  \n\nFirst things first, let's address the elephant in the room: the valuation. NVDA has been soaring to the moon lately, and some might argue that it has become overpriced. But hey, remember what we always say: \"The stonk market can remain irrational longer than we can stay solvent.\" And boy, have we seen that happen time and time again!  \n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Dominance in the GPU Market: NVDA has established itself as a leader in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. With their superior technology and constant innovation, they continue to capture market share and leave their competitors in the dust. This dominance provides a strong foundation for their growth prospects, enabling them to capitalize on emerging trends such as AI, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing.  \n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Expanding into New Markets: NVDA isn't just limited to GPUs anymore. They are strategically diversifying their offerings and expanding into various sectors like data centers, gaming, professional visualization, and even cryptocurrency mining. This versatility reduces their dependency on a single market, increasing their overall resilience and potential for future growth.  \n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 The AI Revolution: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the future, my friends. And NVDA is at the forefront of this revolution. Their GPUs are vital for training and running AI models, making them a key player in the AI ecosystem. As AI continues to permeate various industries, NVDA's position is poised to benefit from the widespread adoption of this technology, leading to exponential growth potential.  \n\nNow, let's tackle the P/E ratio. Yes, it might seem alarmingly high, but sometimes a high P/E ratio can indicate great things for a company:  \n\n4\ufe0f\u20e3 Future Earnings Potential: A high P/E ratio often implies that investors are willing to pay a premium for future growth prospects. NVDA's lofty P/E ratio suggests that the market has high expectations for their earnings potential. And with all the exciting developments in their pipeline, from AI to data centers, these expectations might not be far-fetched.  \n\n5\ufe0f\u20e3 Market Sentiment and Momentum: We all know how much market sentiment and momentum can influence stock prices. A high P/E ratio can attract attention from institutional investors, speculators, and even retail investors. This increased interest can create a positive feedback loop, driving the stock price even higher.  \n\nRemember, my fellow apes, this is not financial advice but rather a perspective on why an overvalued stock with a high P/E ratio like NVDA might not be as bad as it seems. As always, do your own research and make informed decisions.  \n\nDiamond hands, y'all! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udc8e  \n\nDisclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

[But as I briefly mentioned, Chart Industries also has significant potential to increase its sales in relation to potential new EPA carbon emissions regulations in the natural gas industry.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2023/05/11/epa-takes-aim-a-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-coal-gas-powerplants-alliant-midamerican/70209486007/) Chart Industries is a major equipment supplier in the natural gas industry and has moved to significantly diversify its business lines to include water treatment and, importantly for this post, carbon capture technology. If the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations are adopted, carbon capture technology will be a key element in natural gas plants being able to meet the new emissions standards. Chart Industries is well poised to profit off of any such regulation change.\n\n[In 2021, Chart won a subsidies from the Department of Energy to develop carbon capture technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/07/2310264/9318/en/Chart-Industries-Inc-SES-Cryogenic-Carbon-Capture-Technology-Selected-for-Funding-from-the-U-S-Department-of-Energy.html). Most carbon capture technology developed thus far has focused on \"sequestration\", which attempts to lock the carbon underground to prevent its emission into the atmosphere. [However, Chart's technology takes a different approach which is more energy efficient and actually produces a useable end product.  Natural gas power plants use a \"flue\" to disperse unwanted post-combustion gasses after the natural gas is burned to produce power. Chart's technology intercepts the \"flue gases\" before they are released into the atmosphere and liquifies them, thus creating liquid carbon-dioxide and other liquid forms of greenhouse gas.](https://www.chartindustries.com/Products/Carbon-Capture) These liquid gases can then be resold on the open market. As a result, Chart is well poised to profit off of the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations as virtually all natural gas power plants will be forced to implement some type of carbon capture technology in order to meet the new standards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Diagram of Chart Industries carbon capture process](https://preview.redd.it/yfq2z4zfxs4b1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5318cfc476dec8b1e0d7041fbb6f2056cbd46b8a)\n\n[While many naysayers may argue that \"renewables are the future and natural gas is the past\", they ignore that natural gas is currently the largest source of American energy at 36% of total American energy production in the United States.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/data-and-statistics.php) This figure has been rising over the past several years, despite the push for \"green energy\". [Furthermore, there has in the past several months been a lashback by both leftwing environmental groups and conservatives against offshore wind energy, which i will expound upon in the future](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462). The totality of the circumstances shows that natural gas power is not going away anytime soon, and that Chart Industries is well situated to profit off it.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyfa45ljxs4b1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=402cafe5a1c346ff672805244e7ebfae73afb9c7\n\nI am long both GLTS with 141 shares of GLTS and 3 June 16 $120 strike calls  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm2wj1vixs4b1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d4292f0efd6b3fb34a87022cb9b437c27ddabae8",

    "title": "Brace Yourselves! The NVDA Stock Bubble is About to Pop - Here's Why",
    "selftext": "Hey fellow traders,\n\nI hope you're all doing well and staying on top of your game in this crazy market. Today, I want to share my thoughts on a stock that has been gaining a lot of attention lately: NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). Now, before you downvote me to oblivion, hear me out because I believe we might be witnessing a potential bubble about to burst.\n\n**Background:**\n\nNVDA has been on an absolute tear in recent years. The company's dominance in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, coupled with its expansion into artificial intelligence and data centers, has fueled its meteoric rise. As a result, the stock price has skyrocketed, attracting both institutional investors and retail traders alike.\n\n**The Bubble Indicators:**\n\n1. **Valuation Metrics:** Let's talk about the elephant in the room \u2013 NVDA's valuation. As of late, it has reached staggering levels, and it's hard to ignore the warning signs. The price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is through the roof, signaling that the stock may have become overvalued.  \n\n2. **Market Sentiment:** The hype surrounding NVDA is reaching fever pitch, with everyone rushing to jump on the bandwagon. While it's exciting to be a part of such a popular stock, excessive enthusiasm can sometimes blind us to the underlying risks.  \n\n3. **Increased Volatility:** NVDA's volatility has been off the charts lately. While volatility can present trading opportunities, it can also be an indicator of an impending correction. Rapid price swings and an inability to sustain upward momentum could signal a bubble on the brink of bursting.  \n\n4. **Competitive Threats:** NVDA's dominance in the GPU market is facing increased competition. Rival companies are investing heavily in research and development to challenge NVDA's position. If they manage to disrupt NVDA's market share, it could have a significant impact on the stock's future prospects.  \n\n**What Could Happen Next?**\n\nNow, I'm not saying that NVDA is doomed or that you should immediately sell your shares. However, it's crucial to exercise caution and be aware of the potential risks associated with investing in a stock that may be in a bubble.  \n\n1. **A Price Correction:** If the bubble does burst, we could see a significant price correction, potentially wiping out some of the gains that traders have made during the recent rally.  \n\n2. **Volatility Ahead:** Even if a full-blown crash doesn't occur, increased volatility is likely to persist. Swing traders may find opportunities to profit from short-term price fluctuations, but it will require careful timing and risk management.  \n\n3. **Long-Term Prospects:** It's essential to evaluate NVDA's long-term fundamentals and assess whether the current valuation is sustainable. Keeping an eye on the company's performance, market trends, and competitive landscape will be crucial moving forward.  \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRemember, this post is not meant to discourage you from investing in NVDA or any other stock. It's a reminder to stay vigilant, assess risks, and make informed decisions. The NVDA stock bubble may or may not burst, but it's always better to be prepared for any scenario.\n\nAs always, do your own research, diversify your portfolio, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Let's continue to make smart moves and navigate this market together.\n\n*Disclaimer: This post is for informational purposes only and should not be considered as financial advice. Always consult with a qualified financial professional before making any investment decisions.*\n\nEdit: Wow, this post has gained a lot of attention! Thank you all for the insightful discussions and different viewpoints. Remember, healthy",

Almost never actually. Both posts seemed remarkably naive and tender. Like don\u2019t invest in anything exotic without an education. I think maybe \u201cretail FOMO\u201d might better be described as \u201cWSB FOMO\u201d. \n\nSomeone told them they could show up here and \u201cprint money\u201d.\n\nThe CNNMoney Fear Greed Index (CNNFGI) hit 75 today. \n\nI\u2019ve really just stopped by to look at the sentiment these past few days and have been astounded that people are rolling up wanting to start with options and having done **zero** homework. ChatGPT isn\u2019t going to educate them. \n\nPersonally, I found losing money to be my best teacher and I\u2019ve lost a lot. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way. \n\nHow often do tenderfoots just show up and think someone can help them operate a spacecraft in one day? Is this a real thing and how has it been trending? It seems totally whacked out to me. \n\nI would love to look at newbies and their volume and value entering and exiting the market here. There will always be people entering and exiting, but living U.S. adults is a known finite number. What is the net flow for Retail relative to working Americans and relative to total market cap? Money supply is a known. That trend could print every so often. \n\nHas social media replaced humans as the teachers of the younger persons? Or, have I forgotten what it was like to be young? I actually started in options back in college or it didn\u2019t take long anyway for me to start trading options, but I was **literally** copying a friend\u2019s homework. Only I would move my strike prices out a c-hair past his. That pissed him off over time. But then he moved too and I was priced-out. We were good for each other, and I learned a lot from him. \n\nThe first OP has already deleted their post. I\u2019m thinking of Warren Buffet\u2019s fear-greed axiom chiseled into a Japanese Tsunami Stone by our ancestors.\n\nNow, we all live on the beach and pay a premium for the pleasure only to have the fabled wave come along when we think it never will and wash us all away a few times in our lifetimes, but not often enough to teach us anything. \n\nJust when I think I\u2019m out, greed \u201dpulls me back in!\u201d and rinse and repeat. I\u2019ve lost shit pots of money in my life and also made a lot too. Six figure losses by 25 (~1991 or 92 on AAPL no less IIRCC). I was just a kid playing options on Prodigy (pre-AOL). Pershing. I still remember my account number because I traded so many times a day, back in the day. My ears rang for almost a week the first time I lost $100K.\n\nI can\u2019t remember my kid\u2019s birthdays reliably, but I can type my trading account mix of numbers and letters in a tenth of a second. \n\nNow I\u2019m getting old and am having to look at a compressed horizon and reevaluate risk across my remaining years. It\u2019s a weird place to find myself. \n\nKids all got nice college funds. Their accounts actually out performed mine because I was a little more cautious. Pissed me off. Not really. Maybe a little. They bought their first rental home together at 15 & 18. Used it all the way through college and made $167K off of their first real estate play. That\u2019s another story. \n\nEveryone becomes a bear \u2026 \u2026 someday. Mark my words. I\u2019m pushing 60. I lived through an entire lost decade in the 70\u2019s and early 80\u2019s. That shit hurts on the one hand, but I made money playing options by my mid 20\u2019s even during the S&L Crisis. You can always make money. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the \u201cstonks only go up\u201d crowd that were crowing the last time I visited. I think these are neophytes rolling up with a wad of cash to fuel the last melt up.\n\nAnd it looks like the WSB tenor now has the _voice-of-experience_ reminding others about unforeseen dildos and the predictable lack of lubricant. It\u2019s a different WSB. Just saying. \n\nSpeaking of sayings, the saying that stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down isn\u2019t really true for the \u201cbiggies\u201d.\n\nFor a Biggie, there is always the Space Shuttle Columbia that appears at the last moment and returns with this final entry into the mission commanders log: \u201cFate: disintegrated during re-entry\u201d.\n\nA lot of people will lose their money trying to time the event. That\u2019s the circle of life. If I make bank in derivatives, someone else lost and vice versa. Not always true in stocks and bonds. \n\nFear and Greed fornicate every trade in the options markets. There will be greedy put sellers in the last days. Winners and losers. Nothing like it except war. It\u2019s binary. Steel on steel. \n\nAnyway, naive retail FOMO\u2019s rolling up gives my guh bear SPYdr Senses a woody.\n\nYou don\u2019t get many opportunities to short the shit out the market in an entire lifetime. \n\nEvery trader dreams of The Big One!  Might be an opportunity before EoY. Maybe. \n\nOP is probably the nicest person in the world showing up 10 minutes before a lopsided game ends after paying full price for the ticket. He didn\u2019t notice he was actually walking past all the smart people leaving before the rush. \n\nMaybe?\n\nIf I were licensed to give advice, I might recommend 5% bonds and wake up every day and watch Bloomberg and CNBC, watch ALL news channels, even (or especially) the ones that you don\u2019t agree with and always watch the after market analysis.\n\nRead Buffet\u2019s work. Relax and dip the toe in in small chunks so the education they will acquire losing money hand over fist won\u2019t be quite as expensive. Read Bobbleheads and separate retirement from investments from speculation and be diligent about not needing the speculative money. Consider it dead when you put it in and divorce yourself from emotions, but be competitive about winning so you do the work. The cardinal rule is you can\u2019t play without money. Pure speculation is pure gambling in a lopsided house. Schmucks will _\u201dborrow\u201d_ from retirement and investment accounts. That\u2019s a bad idea. \n\nIf he took the advice, maybe by the time they jumped in the market might be oversold. \n\nI think the mods should graph retail FOMO for us on a weekly basis. \n\nMaybe not. WSB would probably alter market sentiment. It\u2019s all a self-fulfilling prophecy then and it would be divorced from reality. Inversing the inverse seems to be a super power around here. When WSB gets frothy, unnatural acts are preformed on the secondary market.\n\nI have devised a WSB Idiot Trap using the 1st flair option. \u201cWSB FOMO: How to trade options with No experience!\u201d.\n\nBot thrashes them, points them to some resources, then auto deletes their messages. \n\nThe bot then gives us the sucker count and trends inside of subject line that literally says, \u201cWSB subreddit traffic statistics\u201d\n\nSetup a couple of flair traps and see if the data means anything.\n\nI like the perceived (mine) of this sub. I would love to see a data cube on WSB sentiment that could be trapped by a bot. \n\nEvery post requires [Nu, Be, Bu] for neutral, bullish, or bearish. That bot data could be powerful if it trended.",

Moreover, a rate increase would also hit small caps the hardest by causing even tighter lending environments. So why would anyone be buying into banks right now?

    "selftext": "Hey guys I have a question. Does anyone else noticed unfavorable rolls on vix index cfds? I mean rolls are supposed to be neutral to your position and should be used to maintain the same value of index as general market values, correct? \nSo if broker index has value of 15 and general market value is 14 after rolling it should be also 14.\nHowever I have noticed several times at my broker that it does not behave like this. It's usually the other way round. \nI think that behaviour is intentional as for example with vix index having down trend rolling it also down would just benefit everyone that is buying calls(and thats like majority of people who buy puts with vix being at 15).\nSo the platform to benefit from it rolls to for example 16 and index have a lot of space to drop down more -making looses for majority of people (who sit on calls).\n\nIm not the one dorectly affected as since I have noticed that im trying to go in only after rolling with intention of closing positions before next roll.",

    "selftext": " \n\nThe current state of the conventional egg market, considering recent price trends and the expected revenue for CALM (Cal-Maine Foods) in the 4th quarter of the year. With a detailed examination of factors such as avian flu outbreaks, chicken population changes, and egg price fluctuations, we aim to provide a convincing argument for a short position on $CALM based on the observed market conditions.\n\nThe conventional egg market has experienced significant fluctuations in recent months due to the avian flu outbreak in the United States. This event resulted in a substantial increase in egg prices, reaching a peak of $5.99 per dozen in December 2022. However, prices are gradually declining as the egg supply returns to normal and the number of chicken deaths decreases. Recent data indicates a decreasing trend in chicken deaths, with only 250 recorded last month. Moreover, certain cities, such as Virginia, have substantially decreased egg prices to $1.29 per dozen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Avian Flu Chicken Death - ](https://preview.redd.it/xfyv5yz86l4b1.png?width=207&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a518643bc63e6c8760eae40b318249f1a1d8f25)\n\n**Price Analysis:**\n\nThe average whole price for conventional eggs currently stands at $1.50, indicating a downward price trend. Additionally, the expected revenue for CALM in the 4th quarter is projected to be $500 million, representing a 50% decrease compared to the previous quarter. This decline is primarily attributed to the decreasing egg prices, even though the sales volume is assumed to remain steady.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lvepckyf6l4b1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a0ee443c4686efbf5edb9e0e861e8fb2b35dfbdc\n\n**Implications for $CALM** : Given the observed market conditions, there is a compelling opportunity to consider shorting $CALM. The expected decrease in revenue for the 4th quarter, combined with the declining trend in egg prices, presents a bearish outlook for CALM's profitability. As the conventional egg market stabilizes, CALM may face challenges in maintaining its previous revenue and profit margins & pay dividends to shareholders as they have 1/3 of net income in dividends. \n\nFurthermore, the option to short CALM stock is currently inexpensive, providing an attractive risk-reward profile for potential investors. As egg prices continue to decline, CALM's financial performance may be negatively affected, thereby leading to a potential decline in its stock price.\n\nBased on the conventional egg market analysis and the expected revenue for CALM in the 4th quarter, there is a convincing argument for a short position on CALM stock. The avian flu outbreak and subsequent fluctuations in egg prices have created a challenging environment for CALM's profitability. Investors may find the current opportunity to short CALM stock appealing, as it aligns with the observed market conditions and offers a potentially favorable risk-reward ratio.",

No surprise there with Gensler\u2019s close ties to SBF and his family. But what\u2019s the core issue? Gensler had a come to Jesus moment where he is suddenly interested in coddling the retail investor because of shitty platforms such as FTX and Binance. But he also lumps coinbase into this mix while on the other hand refusing to work with them in resolving whether some crypto does or does not constitute a security.\n\nSecond to this, Gensler claims the US does not need cryptocurrency which is aligned with the view point of a lot of elderly folk in finance. One such example is the Andrew Left doppelg\u00e4nger Marc Cohodes. Who is Marc Cohodes? He is a whale. A notable short seller who likes to pump the shit out of the companies in his crosshairs. Specifically, pumping negative news and disparaging the CEOs in anyway he can. While some of it is warranted, in the case of coinbase he is mistaken. Continuously failing to note how the SEC has dragged its feet in acting in good faith. But he has a following too. And his following piles in on whatever he calls out. And right now that is coinbase.\n\nSo what is the play? It\u2019s another opportunity to stick it to short sellers. If you have listened to these old finance folks, they hate the current generation of retail investors. They get annoyed that the dynamics they are used to no longer hold. They get irritated that retail investors are so persistent in buying every fucking dip. They get miffed that their shorting strategies can blow up in their face and are no longer easy to execute.\n\nHence, the play is to take the other side of the trade. And if the volume is large enough they will bend the fucking knee.\n\nAll in calls (AUG-18-2023 $110C) and shares; PT easily over $110. Earnings AUG-08.\n\nCommence with memes, and let\u2019s go harpoon a fucking whale.",

The run followed by the drop depicts an almost perfect bull flag. I personally have been waiting for this breakout for about 7 months, knowing that the breakout would bring epic proportions. At this point, one would ask, \"is it too late?\" \"Can I still get in\". Obviously that answer is up to each individual (invest at your own risk). BUT I would like to explain what exactly this breakout could mean for microvision over the next 12 months. Or to be exact, by June 17th 2024. A bull flag breakout's price target is the length of the previous run, added to the breakout point. Our run was 18000%, and our breakout point was roughly $2.42. This then brings us to a price target of $461.28.\n\nYes, that does sound LUDICROUS. But MicroVision is positioned to win multiple OEM contracts THIS SUMMER. MicroVision produces Automotive Lidar (as one of their verticals) and the total addressable market between now and 2030 is $82Billion. MicroVision also has 4 other verticals, totaling the TAM to roughly $200B between now and 2030. I believe that with the current breakout, and extreme growth the market is about to see, MicroVision could continue to run to the price target that we see now formed by the bull flag.\n\nThe bull flag has not only been confirmed with the shape of the graph, but we also received a high volume day @ 33M shares traded, the current daily, weekly and monthly graphs all show string continuation on the RSIs and MACD's and the Bollinger Bands on the weekly have stretched further than... anyways, the momentum for this thing to run for months... or even years is there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MicroVision's lifespan and potential breakout of 20 year downtrend](https://preview.redd.it/0iebtf7lqh4b1.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1c703ad590f758e81cb4f88a500aea275c0c410f)\n\nHere is the lifespan of MicroVisions stock. There is still a LOT of room left for a run, and if the stock breaks above the $20 \\~ mark, there is open water for MILES above.\n\nI know you WSB nerds love to hear about shorts. Currently there are zero short shares available with 47 million shares sold short (175 million float). With our 30% run day TODAY, every single short position is down 30% or more. Some with borrow fees over 50%. This play has been a no brainer to me. MicroVision has over 750 patents, and even has a partnership with Microsoft. Their IP is cited all across the tech world and they have been grossly undervalued.\n\nAbove all, I believe that this stock can hit triple digits without WSB laying a finger on it, but, the more the merrier right?\n\nCall me Dippy, because I bought the dip for 2 years waiting on this exact moment.\n\nSince the mods require positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Since the mods require positions, here is one of my account holdings of MVIS](https://preview.redd.it/fwfobzfnzh4b1.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ef6efddc5ba0ef8ed46011a4ac9cd03e32e5fe28)",

    "selftext": "Not Financial Advice!\n\nIn an attempt to \"protect investors and maintain market integrity\", the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is scrutinizing cryptocurrencies and digital assets. The latest target of this regulatory attention is Coinbase Global Inc., (COIN) - one of the largest crypto exchanges globally for anyone just crawling out from under a rock.\n\nThe SEC's gripes?  They allege that Coinbase, along with other crypto platforms, may be offering products and services involving digital assets that should be classified as securities, and as such, should be registered and regulated. This includes but is not limited to their staking program, where users can earn interest on their crypto holdings.\n\n**Howey Test: The SEC's Litmus Test for Securities**\n\nUnderpinning the SEC's actions is the Howey Test\u2014a 1946 Supreme Court-derived test determining whether an asset qualifies as a security. The test defines a security as an investment in a common enterprise, where investors expect profits primarily from others' efforts.\n\nIn applying the Howey Test to crypto assets, the court would likely consider factors such as:\n\n1. **Investment of Money:** Did investors give something of value (like cash, other crypto assets, services, etc.) in exchange for the asset?\n2. **Common Enterprise:** Are the fortunes of investors tied together, and tied to the success of the issuer's efforts?\n3. **Expectation of Profits:** Did investors expect to profit from their investment, and were those profits expected to come from the efforts of the promoter or a third party?\n\nIf the SEC can convincingly argue that Coinbase's products pass the Howey Test, it could pave the way for a whole new wave of regulatory scrutiny for crypto exchanges. This would mean significant changes in the way they operate and how cryptocurrencies are traded.\n\n**Coinbase's Counter-Argument**\n\nCoinbase is not taking the charges lying down.  It is likely to argue against the application of the Howey Test to the crypto assets it deals with by focusing on the specific prongs of the test. Here's how they might approach each element:\n\n1. **Investment of Money:** While it's clear that most crypto transactions involve an investment of money, Coinbase could potentially argue that certain activities, like staking in a proof-of-stake network, do not involve an investment in the traditional sense. Staking could be seen as more similar to providing a service (validating transactions) rather than making an investment.\n2. **Common Enterprise:** Coinbase might contend that the crypto assets in question do not involve a common enterprise because the fortunes of the individual participants are not tied together in the same way they would be in a traditional investment contract.\n3. **Expectation of Profits:** Coinbase might argue that people buy crypto assets for various reasons, not solely with the expectation of profit. For instance, some people might buy crypto assets to use them in transactions, as a hedge against traditional financial systems, or for ideological reasons.\n4. **Efforts of Others:** Perhaps the most significant argument Coinbase could make is that the value of most crypto assets is not primarily dependent on the efforts of a central party. In decentralized networks, the value of the assets is often tied to the efforts of a broad, decentralized group of contributors (like developers, miners, or validators) rather than a single, central party. Coinbase could argue that this makes crypto assets fundamentally different from traditional securities.\n\n**High Stakes, High Impact**\n\nThe repercussions of this legal battle could be seismic. If the SEC wins, it may lead to the reclassification of numerous cryptocurrencies as securities. This would mean exchanges like Coinbase would have to comply with securities laws, possibly leading to major business restructuring, regulatory oversight, and trading changes.\n\nHowever, Coinbase has a considerable war chest to weather this storm. Their latest balance sheet reveals substantial cash reserves and customer assets, providing a solid financial buffer against potential financial penalties and the cost of restructuring operations.\n\nBut, if Coinbase emerges victorious, it would be a significant win for the cryptocurrency industry, reinforcing the argument that cryptocurrencies don't fall under traditional securities definition. It could also add fuel to calls for less stringent regulation of the industry.\n\n**Market Uncertainty: A Blessing in Disguise?**\n\nWhile the market has reacted negatively to the news, with a notable drop in Coinbase's stock value, this uncertainty may present buying opportunities for discerning investors.\n\nRemember, Coinbase is not just a random player; it's a pioneer in a sector that many see as the future of finance. If Coinbase can navigate through this storm, they could come out even stronger on the other side.\n\nOvercoming this regulatory hurdle would help clarify the regulatory landscape for crypto exchanges, reduce investor uncertainty, and potentially fortify Coinbase's position as a market leader. Additionally, their solid balance sheet provides them with a financial safety net to weather the potential financial implications of the SEC's charges.\n\nIn conclusion, while the SEC's charges introduce uncertainty and a short-term drop in Coinbase's stock price, this could potentially create opportunities for those with a strong belief in the future of Coinbase and the wider cryptocurrency industry. But as always, ensure to do your due diligence before making any investment decisions. Again, *This is not financial advice!!!*",

    "selftext": "Hello my WallStreetBets brethen, I\u2019m back again with a money making post (3rd time). Those who followed me on my last two plays made money (check them out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137ivem/dpst_go_long_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/134s4uk/uvix_play_go_balls_deep_make_money/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)). So, it\u2019s time to buckle up, fellow degenerates, because I'm about to lay out a YOLO-worthy thesis on why now is the perfect moment to go long on VIX and UVIX! \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcc8\ud83c\udf2a\ufe0f I just loaded up myself with 970 shares of UVIX at an average cost of 6.30. \n\n\ud83d\udca5 The Diamond Hands Case for VIX and UVIX \ud83d\udca5\n\nVolatility Party: The current market environment is like a wild party where volatility is the life of the dance floor. While a lot of events that occurred recently have calmed markets (debt ceiling increased, AI hype carrying earnings), there is still a lot uncertainty brewing in the global economy. More importantly though, there are key news cycles and geopolitical events that will occur soon that will result in a prolonged spike on the VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and its leveraged counterpart, UVI. They are poised for an explosive move to the upside. \n\nWhile the market may be buzzing with optimism and bullish sentiments surrounding company earnings, it's important to consider a different perspective. Underneath the surface, there are several factors that could cast a shadow of doubt on the rosy outlook. If reality fails to meet the sky-high expectations, disappointment could grip the market, leading to a spike in the VIX. Uncertainty looms, and any signs of weaker-than-expected earnings, missed revenue targets, or cautious guidance could ignite fear among investors. The VIX, known as the \"fear index,\" would respond accordingly, reflecting heightened market volatility as traders scramble to adjust their positions and protect themselves from potential downside risks. Remember, even the brightest stars can falter, and it's essential to consider both sides of the coin in our perpetual quest for \ud83d\udcb0. \n\nFurthermore, the sustained rally in the S&P 500 in recent weeks suggests to us that retail and big money investors may be keen to take profits at the first sign of weakness.\n\nTiming Is Everything: Timing is crucial in the world of volatility , and it couldn't be more perfect than now. Vix and UVIX aren\u2019t buy and hold forever types of stocks, they\u2019re a buy at a nice price then sell on the spike. VIX and UVIX are trading at 52wk lows (new low made today). At the time of writing, VIX is going for 29.36 while UVIX is going for 6.32. A juiciest of entries if I\u2019ve ever seen one. \n\nAs we've seen in the past, volatility can strike without warning, catching the unprepared off guard. The current macroeconomic landscape is misty, and inexperienced sailors and their portfolios will inevitably be blown off course. \nAs the winds of volatility howl, allow VIX to become your compass, protecting you through the stormy seas of the stock market (as a hedge) or towards untapped riches (as long only).\n\nTLDR : Buy VIX or preferably UVIX (shares preferable, but options dated 1 month out for added risk and leverage. This is WallStreetBets after all! \ud83d\ude0b). Don\u2019t buy higher then 6.90. And the lower it goes from where I bought for UVIX, (6.30), the juicier the entry is for you. Fear not.",

I don't have schizophrenia and I don't have mania to drive my decision making, all I have is logic brain.\n\nSo this is for those who rarely do any research deeper than their youtube conspiracy rabbit hole.\n\n**The debt ceiling bill has been passed.** Not only that but if you did any sort of reading you'd also realize that defense spending has been capped until 2025. National security spending in fiscal 2024 will be capped at $886 billion which would be a roughly 3 percent increase from current levels. In fiscal year 2025, defense spending would be capped at $895 billion, just a 1 percent increase from the previous year. Trust when I saw that this trend will continue if we have a democratic president and/or a democratic majority in Congress. But people rarely think past next Tuesday, let alone consider what our country will look like in 2026 when new leaders of the free world emerge.\n\nNo unprecedented growth, no hefty increases to the Pentagon's budget, just a fixed budget target.\n\n**Where will that money go you might ask?** Sure, some of it will go towards providing support to Ukraine through manufacturing tactical aircraft (which is \\[REDACTED\\] largest seller). I'll tell you right now it's not going towards alien spacecraft technology. It's not going towards ground breaking innovation within the defense industry.

    "selftext": "A lot of the technical indicators and structure of a bear market have already been fucked by this move up, is this because there is no bear market or is it because market makers are trying to fuck us. At this point it seems most people are more bullish than anything, will they really keep letting us make money with calls?!\n\nFor much longer I doubt it, the vix has been absolutely beaten down and usd seems like it's going to follow the same path which will undoubtably allow the market to push higher, I mean after all last year was for the bears and a lot of people had to get out of the market, and while that was happening there has been a build up of cash and people spending credit card money which in turn supplied more money to people to rich old dudes who can invest, so I believe those dudes are gonna push this shit higher in the near term, also it's summer time so old people are probably gonna spend more money and teenagers are probably gonna try and get more summer jobs which will make the economy stronger and push the markets. If bulls are lucky AI will push some big tech earnings and the SPY could see 440-450 within 2 months.\n\nAlthough this move may be sustainable with so many people eager to get back into stocks and use their excess money to buy all this tech up, eventually things may take a turn. Now, September is typically a shit month for stocks based on seasonality and the fed may have already paused or pivot by then, but I believe that somewhere between September of this year and January of next year that stocks are going to reverse back to the gae ber side and if this deep ass yield curve is actually right which it always is supposedly then a reversal in the stock market must be guaranteed at least by February of next year, and don't go and give me any of that \"oh but the market if forward looking, so bullish\", no fuck you, if that was the case we'd be at lows right now, it's not that forward thinking, I'd say it looks forward maybe about a month or two from now, but it's definitely not pricing in a possible collapse in earnings and jobs, now I'm not saying big tech can't clutch and keep the market from falling, but at it's current levels it would have to do a lot of work to keep the market from getting fucked if say everything else starts to fall.\n\nSo what are my expectations for the market during this possible drawdown, well if the yield curve and this massive possible bear market rally is anything to go on, I'd say pretty big, because if the market continues to move up or sideways from here the 200 long term moving average will probably be at 381 or 386 on SPY and if the market does eventually price in a recession it's likely it will breakthrough this long term moving average at the time it's falling which usually causes massive selling due to it's bearish nature, assuming it would cross. But for all we know, market makers and Jim Cramer are just trying to lure in as many people as possible before this epic collapse. Anyways let me know what you think, (im usually a gae ber) if the recession comes (if it's not already here) then I believe it will fuck the market significantly as it sets in, probably in what I assume would be in the time frame of starting from September 2023 - January 2024 of next year, the reversal will definitely start somewhere there, probably, and I think at the end of all that, SPY will bottom somewhere between 380 - 330. I say 380 assuming tech is strong af and stays that way for a year or two and 330 assuming the recession fucks the market bad, more banks start getting fucked, and tech dies down. I think somewhere around 330 is most likely, because eventually SPY will break the 200 moving average with all the upcoming FUD and when it does, it's game over, no cap.\n\nTLDR: I think SPY will go higher near term, 440-450 within 2 months possibly. Longer term I think SPY will start a reversal that inevitably ends between 380-330 and starts in about 3-7 months",

Please be gentle Theta Gang. \n\nAugust 3rd is their Q2 earnings call, and they're predicting a higher profit than was predicted for last quarter. Again, this prediction has not been changed because of the boycott. Exit strategy is to dump the puts after the earnings call (hopefully) announces that they missed the mark. Also the stock may continue to drop in the meantime. Expiration date is further out to minimize theta decay. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep in mind that I consistently lose money on the stock market, and only a complete idiot would take my advice. The chance that the market is wrong and I am right is about 100 to 1. Will post results August 4th.",

    "selftext": "**TLDR: US Gov is in possession of UFOs. Private defense companies such as Lockheed Martin ($LMT) are most likely in possession of these crafts and thus could be a banger investment.**\n\nLegality: This is not financial advice! Only for education.\n\nI wanted to make a post to give some insight into the new developments that is happening within the US Government in regards to UFOs. This is a continuation of my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9zlpn/important_connection_between_ufos_and_defense/) that went kinda viral a few years ago.\n\nBasically, I posted a couple years ago exposing the US Gov's coverup of UFOs. These crafts have been observed defying our understanding of physics and it seems that the government, along with private defense contractors, might be contributing to the largest intelligence failure in US history. That being said, if you aren't aware of the current situation please refer to my last WSB post for context.\n\n**New Developments**\n\nThis morning, an [article](https://thedebrief.org/intelligence-officials-say-u-s-has-retrieved-non-human-craft/) from Debrief details the accounts from a US Gov whistleblower named David Grusch. He explains that the US Government is in possession of intact and partially intact UFOs from nonhuman origin. He further explains that the US government leverages private contractors to store, do research, and reverse-engineer these UFOs. It should also be noted that it is because of these private contractors that the information regarding this mind-blowing technology is kept secret. This means that no matter what security clearance you have (confidential, secret, top secret), you will not have access to these Special Access Programs (SAPs) for UFOs. That being said, I want to emphasize the reason why I'm posting here.\n\n**Double Down**\n\nI'm posting today to double down on my theory that US Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin ($LMT) are great investments due to the strong possibility that these companies are in possession of world-changing technology. Like I said in my previous post, this is an asymmetric investment, meaning that the potential gains of this trade FAR exceed the potential losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x1mjvit98c4b1.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=96d013c069ba793a9161da93634f0c686a70b755\n\n**Additional Resources**\n\n[r/UFOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/) \\- UFO/UAP Sightings posted every single day\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9zlpn/important_connection_between_ufos_and_defense/)\n\n[Debrief Article Fact Check](https://thedebrief.org/fact-check-q-a-with-debrief-co-founder-and-investigator-tim-mcmillan-part-1/)\n\n[Retired Navy Commander David Fravor Describes his Encounter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA-h3dIeD_A)\n\n[Former Defense of Intelligence Official on Public UFO Findings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTdCDfEu6x0)\n\n[Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Proving Luis Elizondo was Head of AATIP](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ez8o2MIVEAM3pzb?format=jpg&name=large)\n\n[Luis Elizondo Interview on U.S. Intelligence Failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MbJpTQD2Uk)\n\n[Luis Elizondo Interview on U.S. in Possession of UFO Debris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7-DhPCG_II)\n\n[Former Director of National Intelligence Speaks Out On UFOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNLCfSnJDgs&t=2s)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"FLIR1\" Video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/2004-nimitz-flir1-video)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"GIMBAL\" video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/gimbal/tag/Tom+Delonge)\n\n[In-Depth Breakdown of \"GOFAST\" Video](https://thevault.tothestarsacademy.com/2015-go-fast-footage)",

    "selftext": "Up until very recently I was in compliance supervision for a large U.S. financial services company, working specifically in the brokerage, or investment services, division.  My responsibility was to oversee the sales activity of approximately 50 Financial Advisors on a daily basis.  Sales activity could include solicitation of new clients or prospects to open an account or purchase an investment product, or sales activity with existing clients (mutual fund switch, managed \"wrap\" account, variable annuity liquidation with a CDSC, etc.).  Before that I assisted several Financial Advisors (FA) as what some refer to as a sales or client associate, which is an assistant for the operations and some sales aspects of the FA's daily business.  I would give you my CRD number so you could verify the good standing of my 7, 9/10, 63, and 65 licenses, but if you work in the industry then I hope you can verify the voracity of my claims for yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart of me is writing this for cathartic and therapeutic purposes.  Another part of me wants to peel back the curtain a little bit for those who have not worked for a large broker-dealer and may be oblivious to just how fucked this industry is.  Hope you get some enjoyment from it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nGuys, I have to tell you a secret.  There's a little problem in the investment services industry.  In an ideal world, everybody would act virtuously and ethically, with regard above all for the well being and best interest of those whom an individual is hired to serve.  But for a person who sells investment products, there is an additional incentive in the form of compensation.  And the compensation in the financial sector is fucking sweet.\n\nAs an aside, I've come to realize something: if you want to find the industries that pay extremely well, have lots of security and very little personal accountability, just look to the ones that are rife with nepotism: law, entertainment, finance., etc.  Some people work so their kids have a better life, others want to make damn sure their kid enjoys the same honeypot they have.  But I digress.\n\nAs I mentioned, the compensation for selling financial products is so sweet it'd send a diabetic to the E.R.  You can make a great living in other areas of sales, when you get to certain levels.  But finance is special in that you are being compensated most of the time in direct proportion to the amount being invested.  For instance, if you are a pencil salesperson, you might sell it for $2.00 and get to keep .50 of that while the company keeps the other $1.50 for producing the pencil for you to sell.  When selling financial products, however, you are asking how much money somebody wants to invest and you are taking a percentage of that.  Investing $100,000?  I'm keeping $1k of that.  Investing $1,000,000 instead?  Oh boy my cut is now $10,000.  And so on.\n\nSo immediately you can see there is a conflict here in that when posed with the question of whether your money should be invested with a financial rep or \"Financial Advisor\" (FA) as I will often refer to them, as they will benefit more if you invest more of your money with them.  But there is another oddly concerning variable when it comes to the compensation of those selling these products, in that different financial products pay FA's different percentages.  For instance, an FA might get paid 7% of money invested in a whole life insurance product or variable annuity, whereas the FA would only get 1% if the money was invested in a c-share mutual fund.  But this isn't the only funny business happening with FA compensation: an FA can, in fact, charge a higher percentage for the exact same product.  So let's break down what these means in real world examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's say a customer walks into XYZ bank and has $500,000 to invest.  They sit down with FA Bob Moneygrubb who looks over their finances and starts thinking about how to invest this $500,000.  Now, if Bob invests all $500,000 in a c-share mutual fund, for simplicity let's say Bob will get 1% of that, or $5,000, to his \"production grid\" (I can expand on this for anybody interested).  Then, after the firm takes its cut (which can range widely depending on what the firm provides the selling FA for office space, equipment, etc.).  When all is said and done, Bob now has $1,000 from your investment in his pocket.  But Bob could do something else here.  He could also take $250,000 of your money and invest it in a variable annuity, which let's assume pays Bob 5%.  With the other half he could invest in the C-share mutual fund, paying the same 1%.  Now what does Bob get paid?  He receives $12,500 for the variable annuity and $2,500 for the c-share trade, or $15,000 to his grid.  Bob stands to make three times as much off your ass if he can convince you to invest half of your hard earned money in a longer term, higher cost product.  He will receive $25,000 if he can convince you to put all $500K into the variable annuity.  Sell, Bob, sell!  One has to ask, what is the likelihood that the person selling these financial products is going to be able to ignore the triple higher pay and do the right thing for the client, regardless?\n\nHere's another interesting fact.  Brokerage firms have managed portfolios called \"wrap\" accounts, or fee-based accounts.  Instead of the typical up front commission an FA would usually receive, they instead will agree with the client to charge a fixed percentage fee on all of the money invested in the wrap ccount, and a third party manager will take care of rebalancing and the due dilligence (i.e. 1.5% annually).  But guess what?  An FA is also able to adjust the fixed percentage they are charging you.  Which means just by walking into the wrong office, or meeting the wrong FA, you could take an enormous hit over the life of your investments.  I'll show you what I mean.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnfortunately for Bob Moneygrubb, you've decided you don't want to take his initial advice and invest half of your money in a variable annuity and the other half in a C-share.  But Bob wants to show you something else, a wrap-account where a third party manages the account and takes care of rebalancing and trading, all for the cost of 2%.  This sounds like a great idea, since you are now going to be managed by the pros over at Madoff investment funds and you still have access to an FA for any other questions that may pop up (do I need to take an IRA distribution this year?).  But here's what Bob doesn't tell you.  Every single FA at XYC bank has access to this product, and can charge as low as 1% without taking a \"hit\" to their own payout.  Because Bob believes his shit doesn't stink and deserves 2%, you're now going to lose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in returns over the course of your life that are paid to Bob as fees.  I hope this annual review comes with a reach-around!   (By the way, a nifty tool for analyzing the effects of fees on your investments is the Finra Fund analyzer, it's a free tool available to everyone here [https://tools.finra.org/](https://tools.finra.org/)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as you can see the FA has a lot of different ways they can be compensated, and it is very flexible in that they can choose to get their money up front or over the life-time of the investment depending on what product they sell and what sales charge it has.  I'll bet you can guess where this is going,  but I'm here to spoil the ending.  As it turns out, people in positions of power and responsibility don't always act ethically, especially when faced with an incentive to get paid a shit-ton more for selling certain products rather than others.  Now you'd think the robust compliance and oversight system in place in both broker-dealers and as implemented by FINRA, the SRO that enforces and builds upon regulatory framework laid out by the SEC and other bodies, would be enough to ensure human's worst thoughts, desires and behaviors are squelched and obliterated, but it turns out that's not the case......\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Regulation Best Interest: The Game Changer That Wasn't (Part 2) COMING SOON**\n\nEdit: part 2 preview \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2019 / 2020, Regulation Best Interest was rolled out to further clarify what it meant to be a fiduciary and to act in the best interest of a client vs. ones self or the company, along with more red tape intended to help control FA behavior and ensure appropriate recommendations were made.  In part 2, I'll detail why it was an epic failure and how you can still get fucked high, wide and frequent, even with all the new fancy red time FINRA's came packing with.

    "selftext": "Trading Thesis: Tracking the float along with daily volume along with company financials helps to narrow down moving tickers\nFundamental and technical analysis is often used to find growth tickers and information about them. Fundamental analysis looks to see whether an investment is overvalued or undervalued based on underlying economic conditions, as well as the finances of the company or other organization that issued a stock or bond. Technical analysis instead looks at patterns in the price of an investment to predict future movements in that investment\u2019s price.\u00a0\nI look for tickers that are trading at least 2 million in volume a day, with a market-cap of no less than 500 million.\u00a0\nThe shares traded are compared to the average volume to determine how much of the float is used (Or shares traded). That information is compiled with data on how profitable the company is and how much cash do they have compared to what is expected.\n\n\nUptrending Tickers\u00a0\n\n\n* MTCH  6/16/23  39C. 1.64\n* BLUE  6/16/23  2.5C  1.15\n* SPCE  6/16/23  3C  .85\n* RIG  6/16/23  6C  .06\n* JPM  6/16/23  142C  1.65\n* UCAR  6/16/23  12.5C  1.40\n* KVUE  6/16/23  25C  .60\n* FL  7/21/23  25C  1.60\n\n\nDowntrending Tickers\n\n\n* VEEV  7/21/23  180P  1.70\n* CCL  6/16/23  12.5P  .59\n* EH  6/16/23  10P  .40\n* EXPE  6/16/23  100P  1.48\n* FCEL 6/16/23  2.6P  .37\n* DLTR  6/16/23   132P  1.76\n* COST  7/21/23  450P  1.56\n* DKNG  6/16/23  25P  1.23\n* COST  7/17/23  450P 1.56\n\n\nThings to consider when finding the plays-\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the stock volume has traded 1 million or more in volume premarket, I will use that and calculate a rough estimate on what the stock will trade for the day.\u00a0\n\n\u00b7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If the ticker looks to be trading more volume than the day before, I will consider it for a long play.

So far, it's working out. I have a strong thesis and think the risk to reward ratio is worth it. I hope my conviction pays off.\n\nAll this AI money is going to rotate into computer vision.

    "selftext": "**Recap On Last Weeks Market Action:**\n\n* SPY closed up 1.45%\n* QQQ closed up 0.75%\n* Dow Jones Industrial closed up 2.12%\n* VIX closed down 6.59%\n\n\\*\\* For some reason images were not allowed to be posted, can be access through my website but not necessary\\*\\*\n\nGood evening everyone, I hope this past weekend has allowed you to relax and prepare for the upcoming week. Although this was only a 4 day week we still saw nice upward moves across the market. We are also beginning to see broader participation in the market rally. The only major schedule announcements for this week are jobless claims coming out Thursday morning.\n\nSPY continued pushing above a long base and closed strongly on Friday. Even though this was a shorter week, volume on the weekly chart was only marginally below average. SPY also had larger weekly price gains than QQQ. This could be signalling that the market rally is finally broader and spreading to other industries and sectors. Price is approaching August 2022 highs which may act as an area of resistance.\n\nQQQ has been much stronger than SPY over the past few weeks. This is largely due to a select few mega cap stocks making huge advances. QQQ is somewhat extended and it would not be surprising to see a pause soon. Sideways action here would be constructive as it would give underlying stocks the chance to form new bases. With that in mind, there are still plenty of ETFs that have broken out of bases as well as those that are currently approaching base breakouts.\n\nARKG is an ETF that focuses on genomics companies and has a trigger price of $33.70. There are two things that catch my eye when examining this chart. First, in the last few weeks there is more heavy buying volume than selling volume. Second, there is a large tail bar that got rejected at the trigger price. Therefore, if price begins to breakout, it must be associated with heavy buying volume to get past the sellers at that price. If price is advancing on only average volume this would be a risky purchase.\n\nCLOU is a cloud computing ETF that is approaching a long downward trendline that began forming in August 2022. This is not the cleanest chart as it is clear that there is alot of variability in price. A push above Fridays buys could be an entry point. However, a safer entry would pushing above $19.50 with heavy buying volume.\n\nFFTY is an ETF that tracks 50 stocks that match IBDs growth selection criteria. Friday saw a large pop in price that put FFTY within striking distance of a base breakout. This base breakout could be met with extra resistance as the base roughly coincides with the 200 day EMA (white).\n\nIJH is an ETF that tracks mid-cap stocks. IJH is fastly approaching the trigger price of $251.60 as a result of Fridays price gains. We saw a sharp decline in price that coincided with several bank collapses. However, price found support and has been trading sideways since.\n\nTNA is very similar to IJH except it tracks small-cap stocks instead of mid-caps. The price action is just below the trigger price of $33.00. However, TNA is sitting below the 200 day EMA (white) which may lead to some resistance.\n\nWhile there are only a handful of ETFs that I found to be approaching base breakouts, there are many more that are currently beyond their price bases. This is a positive sign as is shows stocks that broke out are working and new setups are still forming. The most encouraging ETFs on this list are the mid-caps and small-caps. These demonstrate that there is finally a broader participation in the market rally. This is what is truly needed for the market to actually advance. The best way to capitalize on these bases is to look at the top ten holdings in each and exam the chart setups.\n\nAs always you should conduct your own research before making any sort of investment.\n\nIf you have any comments or question on what is discussed in the article or otherwise please feel free to reach out!",

However, things are brighter on the service side which supported the U.S. Economic Surprise Index to its highest level since January 2022.\n\n\u2022\tConsumer confidence declined in May, primarily due to a less upbeat assessment of current employment conditions. Personal savings rate decreased in April for the first time since September 2022. Delinquency rates for credit card borrowers are approaching 2008 levels.\n\n\u2022\tHousing market indicators have shown mixed results, with the FHFA House Price Index and Case-Shiller 20-City Composite reporting modest increases, while real estate investor home purchases saw a significant decline.\n\n\u2022\tRent growth has stalled in the US, with a minimal increase in May compared to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\u2022\tBut the darkest hour is always before dawn.

    "title": "How to profit off AI rally (hint it's not in tech) and why the rally might not be over.",
    "selftext": "**How to profit off the AI rally:**\n\nTo put it simply, to make money off the AI rally you take big positions in other sectors so that when institutions rotate gains out of tech, you benefit from the shift.  As institutions are dumping their tech bags, you gotta look for where they're going next and get in with them. Look for high volume buying or accumulation in sectors that are beaten down. but these types of plays mean you might have to sit a while b4 you experience any gains. If you want quicker gains or lottos, you can see which other sectors have high volume buying pressure and take lottos (weeklies) early on those if you wanna gamble. But LEAPS is what I'm mostly talking about.\n\n**Shorting tech might not be a good idea:**\n\nI wouldn't short tech unless you have a good thesis or see heavy institutional selling. Institutions will let the rally go as high as retail is willing to pay. Then they enter the distribution phase and begin dumping shares. Shorting pullbacks on a rally isn't smart because it takes many small rallies for institutions to unload bags on retail. Sell offs can bounce back easily because institutions simply stop selling and then they let retail run the price back up off the dip. That way institutions can keep unloading at their target price.\n\nImagine institutions dump 1/4 of their positions. Tech sells off. Bears think it's crash. Institutions stop selling and selling pressure goes away (they drive the selling pressure). Then with institutional selling pressure gone, retail dip buyers bring the price back up to institution's price target where they dump another 1/4 of their shares. So on and so forth before they finally unload the last of their position and then tech goes into free fall.\n\nHere\u2019s a chart I made to explain. Red line is institutional selling pressure. Green line is retail buying dip (no institutional selling meaning limited supply meaning demand drives price up).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/847mnl09k14b1.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=42868f9a2aae685bf2e81d3fa84583ac32f75f22\n\n**Why tech might keep going up:**\n\nThis is just a generalization. Even with these factors driving market structure, the overall market and even tech may still trend higher for a while. This is because the concentration of the market\u2019s rally is in tech, and as money rotates into other sectors we may see the rest of the market rise. Retail may see the market rise (as a result of lagging sectors rising), and think \u201cmarket go up, me keep investing in tech\u201d. Institutions also know this broadening of market gains will create psychological demand in their customers (the retail they sell their stocks to), and may have tech bags they\u2019re willing to dump even higher than the current \u201ctop\u201d of tech. And by the way, I wouldn't be investing in tech personally after this really even though it may still rise.\n\n**Market is an auction and why this matters:**\n\nBut you might say \u201churr durr economy doing bad\u201d blah blah blah like yeah I know. Everybody knows. The market is an auction, though. It has everything to do with what is the highest price that people will pay for the stocks that institutions are holding.\n\nIf the movement and flow of institutional money is creating bullish signals in the market, the public will sense that pressure to buy regardless of their trading knowledge and be willing to pay higher and higher prices for stocks. The movement of institutional money affects prices and when people see prices move they fomo into the market. Demand goes up because people don\u2019t want to miss out. They don\u2019t understand the market.\n\nThe news cycle, economic woes, and war has scared retail into selling their shares dirt cheap to institutions, and the public has been waiting to get back in. What happens when the public all wants to get in at once? Demand soars and prices of stocks soar because people want in. It becomes impossible to get in the market at a good price for retail because they all want in at once (limited supply since institutions control supply and aren\u2019t selling). If there is public demand, institutions who control the supply can determine at which point they will provide the product. If institutions chose to not unload their bags, there will be limited supply to meet the new influx of high demand. This drives the price up to the institution's price targets at which point they begin distribution.\n\nThis is why stock prices can go up even if it doesn't make sense.\n\nLong story short, the news cycle is only good for trying to guess whether institutions are going to try and accumulate (buy low) or distribute (sell high) their product (stocks) to customers (retail).\n\n**TL;DR:** If you\u2019re going to short tech, know that you are going against the trend and you\u2019ll be lucky if you short into a pullback. If you want to make gains buy LEAPs on underperforming sectors that have institutions rotating into them. You may have to sit on those LEAPs a long time because prices may fluctuate in those sectors until institutions have finished accumulating. If you want to lotto, maybe find sectors that are STARTING to rally on high volume after any kind of sell off in tech and gamble there.\n\nEdit: ppl asking what sector I'm watching, banking.",

    "selftext": "After being cast aside for the past 2 years and forming a strong basing pattern, ARKK is all set for it's next bull run. The blue zone highlighted on the chart is what's known as an order block, which is an area where institutional buy orders are congregated. Order blocks are formed when large institutions want to establish a long position in a stock, but lack the liquidity to do so. To get around this, they first initiate a small short position, driving the stock price down, triggering stop losses. They then take the opposite side of those stop loss orders, establishing their substantially larger long position. During the 2020 bull run, the institutions were making huge profits on their long positions, but were losing money on their short position. Thus, the institutions took profit on their long positions, driving the price of ARKK back down to where they first initiated their short position to close their short position for either a tiny loss or no loss at all. Now that the institutions have likely closed out all of their short positions, there is nothing left to stop ARKK from going up. This almost perfectly coincides with inflation peaking and the eventual Fed rate hike pause. For those who didn't buy during the 2020 mania and only began accumulating in the recent 1-2 years, congratulations on your future well-deserved profits. Price target is $84.65 in the next 1-2 years.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bmde6uxu4x3b1.png?width=1812&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b53f2d9911c724124e1297888965ac5269c39360",

    "selftext": "OPEC+ is striving to sustain oil prices while avoiding disputes. Interestingly, as soon as the group stopped holding monthly meetings, prices immediately spiraled out of control.\n\nIndeed, there's no one to blame here, as circumstances beyond the member\u2019s\u2019 contract have unfolded unfavorably. But it's still quite amusing.\n\nJust two months ago, they had to hastily cut production without holding any meeting. The move was dramatic, but short-lived.\n\nSo, why not try it again?\n\nLast week, Saudi Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman [cautioned short-sellers against betting on a decline](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13qkuaj/i_keep_warning_them_that_they_will_be_hurting/), hinting at potential action. But it's not as simple as it seems.\n\nReal production cuts only began in May, and the impact has not yet been felt. Bloomberg calculated that OPEC's production has fallen by only 0.5 million bpd relative to April, and by 1 million bpd relative to February.\n\nThis is less than the 1.2 million bpd announced in April (formally it was 2 million, but part of it was simply a shortfall of quotas). Even so, disregarding the slump during the pandemic, OPEC's production is at its lowest level since the crisis year of 2009.\n\nAs early as last fall, not everyone considered cuts to be a good idea. The UAE was unhappy that they were not able to utilize their recently upgraded production capabilities. At the moment, 30% of UAE capacity is sitting idle, a figure even larger than Iran\u2019s.\n\nThere are also questions among OPEC+ members regarding the pace of cuts, and the discussion at the meeting promises to be heated.\n\nRaising prices would be beneficial. But announcing a reduction that will not be implemented is risky. It could undermine the group\u2019s credibility and influence. And the further the ordered cuts go, the harder it will be to achieve agreement and discipline within the cartel.\n\nI suspect that if another cut is necessary, an agreement will be reached. But it's unlikely to happen tomorrow. The situation just isn\u2019t tat dire\u2014at least, it isn\u2019t yet. Prices have been rising for two days, short-sellers are reducing their risks just in case, and overall market optimism has increased.\n\nI expect that tomorrow OPEC will limit itself to verbal interventions. **WTI prices will not stray far from $70 and will return to that level within one to two weeks.** Volatility will decrease.\n\nIf production is indeed cut, we might see a jump to $80, but this would look like an all-in from OPEC. They would have to hope for a recovery in Chinese demand. Otherwise, a deeper fall is inevitable, and there won't be tools to contain it\u200b.",

UVYX SVXY SPKY\n\nThere are three values you should consider when trading UVIX\n\n1. Cash VIX \u2013 RED box\n2. Front Month VIX \u2013 GREEN box\n3. Back Month VIX \u2013 YELLOW box\n\nUVIX ALWAYS tracks the FRONT month VIX, NOT the regular VIX which is the CASH VIX.\n\nIf cash VIX goes up 100% and FRONT month VIX stays the same, UVIX won\u2019t move one single penny.\n\nIf FRONT month moves up 10% and CASH VIX stays flat then UVIX goes up 20%.\n\nThis etf resets every single day after the close. I will explain in the next paragraph.\n\nThe issues has a number of contracts that has to roll in a month. Lets say for example that the number of contracts is 1000. The issuer has to split those 1000 in equal number based on the number of trading days between rollover dates. Let\u2019s assume there are 20 trading days in a rollover month. That\u2019s 500 contracts per day that have to be converted. The issuer HAS to sell 500 per day at the FRONT month value (16.94 right now) and buy back at the BACK month value which is 18.75. It is like selling a loaf of bread for $3 and buy it back at $4. You\u2019ll ALWAYS lose money. Same with UVIX.\n\nNow, those 20 trading days are in between the rollover dates. The rollover date is the Wednesday after the third Tuesday in the month. Next rollover date is June 21st. Next one July 19 and so on.\n\nBy the end of the THIRD Tuesday in the month (the end of the rollover and the start of the new one) CASH VIX and FRONT MONTH VIX have to overlap. Right now CASH is 14.60 and FRONT is 16.94. By June 20 4PM CASH and FRONT have to have the same value (plus-minus 10-20 pennies).\n\nEither CASH goes up to 16.94 to meet the FRONT month and UVIX stays flat, or FRONT month VIX drops to 14.60. If VIX CASH stays flat until the next rollover date then the FRONT month will HAVE to drop about 14%.\n\nUVIX being a 2x VIX futures will drop 28%. They could meet above the CASH value, below or anywhere in between. But they HAVE to overlap.\n\nOn June 21 when the futures rollover JULY becomes FRONT month and August BACK month. And so on.\n\nCONTANGO  is when FRONT month is lower in value than the BACK month. Just like now.\n\nBACKWARDATION happens when the FRONT month is higher in value than the BACK month. This happens about 2x per year and that is the best time to buy puts in UVIX. Backwardation doesn\u2019t last more than a few days unless we are in a 2008 situation or March 2020. From my experience once the futures are in backwardation UVIX drops between 40-60% in a matter of weeks.\n\nThere are two major risks with these instruments. A market meltdown or they are delisted.\n\nMy idea of trading is learn one product and trade only that.\n\nMy motto is: rather lose an opportunity than lose money.\n\nUVIX offers daily 2x leveraged exposure to short-term VIX futures, designed to capture the implied volatility of the S&P 500, in a commodity pool wrapper. As a geared product, UVIX is designed as a short-term trading tool and not a long-term investment vehicle. Returns over holding periods greater than one day can be, and often are, significantly different from 2x. Like its peer products, UVIX does not deliver leveraged returns on the VIX index itself, but on front- and second-month futures contracts that are rolled daily. Structured as a commodity pool, investors will get K-1 at tax time but avoid the counterparty risk of an exchange-traded note.",

The company is spearheaded by CEO Peter Chapman, who has a rich background in machine learning from his time at Kurzweil Technologies. IonQ's research shows that QML, despite its infancy, often outperforms its classical counterparts. This is primarily due to quantum mechanics principles of superposition and entanglement, which enable the creation of new machine learning algorithms that can solve problems that classical computers cannot handle. Chapman envisions QML to become as impactful as large language models, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, in the future.\n\nIn terms of hardware, IonQ has built three trapped-ion quantum computers: IonQ Harmony, IonQ Aria, and IonQ Forte, each with its unique capabilities. Their next major technical milestone is achieving 35 algorithmic qubits (AQ) which, beyond this point, will make it more cost-effective to run models on actual quantum machines than simulating them classically. IonQ also collaborates with leading tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Microsoft, and NVIDIA to integrate their quantum technology with the partners' AI and machine learning expertise.\n\nFurther, IonQ is venturing into Quantum Artificial Intelligence and has already published research on modeling human cognition. This field of study employs quantum computers to simulate human cognition, potentially offering powerful insights into artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsource: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2023/06/02/a-quantum-leap-in-ai-ionq-aims-to-create-quantum-machine-learning-models-at-the-level-of-general-human-intelligence/?sh=31c398187b88](https://www.forbes.com/sites/moorinsights/2023/06/02/a-quantum-leap-in-ai-ionq-aims-to-create-quantum-machine-learning-models-at-the-level-of-general-human-intelligence/?sh=31c398187b88)",

As a side note my wife is a Yoga instructor and I appreciate how Lulus accentuate her wonderful T&A.  So theres that...\n\nAround 350PM EST Thursday I figured what the heck and started putting limit orders for 340 calls expiring June 16 at around $1k a peice.  Typically with big $ (for me) calls, i will add limit buys around $50 bux lower since there is a fair amount of swing in the option price. I had two limit buys and ended up getting a total of 3 340 calls june 16.\n\nI also put a limit buy in for 100 shares. This was just to play earnings with and not long term. Set a limit of 327.50 and lo and behold she executed prior to close.\n\nThen the waiting game after close, initially it bounced down, but then started swinging up rapidly. I didn't really do the math but I wanted to put a safe limit sell  and not miss it so I kind of arbitrarily chose 350. Obviously I could of made more, but I was super stoked I had just made about $2500 in a very short amount of time.\n\nAfter hours price went up around 370 and i was giddy with anticipation for the next morning. WOke up early AF out here (341 AM hawaii time) and was sad to see she lost some of the oomph she had pre market (hit 383 i believe) but I was happy enough to unload two of my calls for a quick \\~5200 bux. I wanted to hold the last one as I was thinking of executing assuming i could scrounge up the money to actually purchase 100 shares, but to my shagrin the price stayed relatively steady until continuing lower towards EOD. When she hit around 370 one last time little past noon EST I unloaded the last call for another \\~2200 bux.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chg1ey3r3r3b1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3a7f1f78c16cf3269fdc5236405de10d75e5393f\n\nAnd there was a bonus to already good day as I had been buying and selling CROX 110 calls making good money first unloading most Monday then getting more Wednesday/Thursday.

    "selftext": " **The Debt Ceiling's Historical Roller Coaster**\n\nOver the years, the debt ceiling has taken us on a wild journey. If we glance at the table of historical debt ceiling levels, we can see that it has steadily increased over time. On December 16, 2021, the debt ceiling reached an astonishing 31,400 billion dollars.\n\n There have been instances where the debt ceiling was temporarily suspended, allowing the government to borrow without a predetermined limit. We witnessed such suspensions on August 2, 2019, and September 30, 2017, among other occasions. These suspensions provide a glimpse into the intricate financial dynamics at play.   \n\n\n**Correlation Analysis: Debt Ceiling and S&P 500**\n\nDigging into the juicy part: how does the change in the debt ceiling correlate with the S&P 500's performance? I conducted a correlation analysis to shed light on this intriguing relationship.  \n\n\n1. **Change in Debt Ceiling vs. 1 Month % Change in S&P 500 (-0.255)**\n\nThe correlation coefficient of -0.255 suggests a moderate negative relationship between changes in the debt ceiling and the S&P 500's one-month percentage change. This indicates that as the debt ceiling increases, there appears to be a slight tendency for the S&P 500 to experience a decrease in value in the following month. It's a delicate balancing act that influences market sentiment.\n\n1. **Change in Debt Ceiling vs. 6 Month % Change in S&P 500 (-0.188)**\n\nThe correlation coefficient of -0.188 reveals a weak negative correlation between changes in the debt ceiling and the S&P 500's six-month percentage change. In simpler terms, when significant changes occur in the debt ceiling, the S&P 500 tends to exhibit a slightly lower performance six months down the line. Remember, though, that the market dance involves many other players, so this relationship isn't the sole determining factor.\n\nRemember, correlation doesn't imply causation, and it's crucial to consider other factors influencing the S&P 500's movements.   \n\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts, interpretations, and personal experiences in the comments below.

The research series REMOVES agricultural job holders from the Household Survey. Then there are multiple job holders with multiple salaries. Remove them as well. So we get 3 numbers:\n\n1. Household Survey = **MINUS** 310,000 jobs\n2. Establishment Survey = **PLUS** 339,000 jobs\n3. Household Survey Research Series = **PLUS** 394,000 jobs.\n\nThis means that there is a LARGE gap of (394,000 + 310,000 =) 704,000 jobs that were part of the agricultural + multiple salary holders group. So the following would need to happen:\n\n1. Agricultural jobs was massively reduced.\n2. Multiple salary holders would need to decrease.\n\nWe then go to the handy FRED [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12034560](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12034560):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vd6ittpmm3b1.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=89d1201503f2e1e6ead9cfd8ebfee946a0506e40\n\nWe can see the # of new agricultural jobs is PLUS ZERO!!! This means that (2) Multiple salary job holders got reduced by a **WHOPPING 704,000**!!!!\n\n**This indicates most likely higher income people with multiple jobs are getting laid off from their 2nd or 3rd of 4th jobs, and can only retain fewer jobs.**\n\nThe unemployment rate sadly is calculated using the household survey, but technically should use the Research Series, which removes agricultural jobs and multiple job holders. A better approach is to just create an unemployment rate which keeps agricultural jobs, but removes multiple job holders.\n\n# Birth Deaths issue\n\nThere are some explanations out there on the birth deaths issue of +231,000 from the BLS. Ie people are saying the birth deaths model is randomnly adding 231,000 extra new jobs into the NFP number.\n\nWhat is the birth deaths model? This is not population births and deaths, but COMPANY births and deaths. New companies come into the market, but there is a lag of a few months until they start reporting in the NFP survey. So, the BLS takes this lag into account, and adjusts the NFP number.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lisijgksnm3b1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=05a4be4e2d1705a8569dbdedf3845c3dde454316\n\nPeople are saying the 339K is FAKE, and 231K is just part of the birth deaths model. But that's an overcharged explanation, since every May, interestingly ALWAYS we get a lot of births of new companies..... See last year 2022 May:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n614k3jom3b1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=290cae3138643bd8475bce420317027038b2d954\n\nPlus the birth death model is NOT SEASONALLY ADJUSTED................. This means the number will most likely get removed by seasonal adjustments. Not the unemployment rate AND NFP are both seasonally adjusted.\n\n# Other points\n\nSadly the black unemployment rate jumped quite dramatically from 4.7% to 5.6%. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/resz1e92pm3b1.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=1f1bb15a5f9ddcf1ae319ac84fc68a99f5ff5723\n\nMale, Female and Total participation rates seem unchaned.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7l69zpzapm3b1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b697bfa0474c21c6a3ed5f4ba70ef4ed2f892ea2\n\nConcerningly, the youth participation rate is going DOWN for the past 4 months now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnuzq43mpm3b1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b1a78b0b7af17794c22d712add12b2d8bb62aef8\n\n# Fed\n\nThe report was very strong, not weak as some pundits probably latched onto the rise of the unemployment rate. **The issue as explained was mainly due to the reduction of 700,000 multiple salary holders jobs.**\n\nJune meeting hike chance actually INCREASED from 20% to 35%, but most likely a \"skip\" or \"pause\". The issue is the July meeting with the 25bps hike increased to 52% from 45%. A 50bps increase chance increased from 9% to 19%, so all in all, a 51% chance of a 25bps hike in July.\n\nThe next important report is Monday's ISM Services, then obviously CPI Inflation on June 13. Inflation is expected mainly to result from housing and the core components, with the Bloomberg survey approximately at +0.3 to +0.4%% ish for Core.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra70oieypm3b1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=a60bdf8ad26f69e605efe3907fb41fb892f98faf\n\n# Markets\n\nThe S%P500 is nearly at 4300. Today's unemployment shock increase is most likely fueling markets, yet I'm guessing from midday onwards, markets will follow the bond market, gold and dollar, and digest that the Fed will maybe pause in June, but will hike 25bps in July.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adgpsdufrm3b1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=54f311ae38e0f6e365a424fabd192e7432104e09\n\nThe S&P500 is extremely overbought, with today's action extremely outside the Bollinger 20SMA + 2std lines, literally touching the 3std line. Coincidentally, Feburary 3rd had a similar pattern, funnily also after a very strong NFP report.\n\nNo matter how you dissect whether the S&P will go down a lot, current levels are way too extreme. Even the April 1st ish point had a small pullback, yet it wasnt' that dramatically close to the 3\\*std line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8do85dhyrm3b1.png?width=666&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4bc77c9823b9588da3f65824fa22937a6a152e61\n\nThe Put Call ratio 5 day moving average is again at all time lows. Highly highly problematic now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0i7yu1t2sm3b1.png?width=682&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2fadc435086c9f21005028c3d7e907738d0f7721\n\nThe market in relation to the bond market is screaming overbought, with yields climbing dramatically higher (10 Year + 0.08% and 2 Year + 0.158%). Dollar is up +0.5%. Gold down a whopping -1.2%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t7xug3ijsm3b1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9d7bc97a9120a0965a7785ec61c7ab710f020f26\n\nGDP Now is now +2%, with consumption down from 1.58% to 1.26%, offet by a rise in investment. First quarter spending was +2.48% consumption, so consumption has halved in percentage terms.\n\nIt's possible the S&P500 might get to 4,300 ish or around 4309 ish, the 61.8% Fibonacci line, though that's possible only. It doesn't have to directly touch it though.\n\nThe equal weight S&P500 RSP managaed to pop +2% ish today after a few months of bad performance due to the oversaturation of big tech.\n\nIn general, markets were partially overbought, but today just looks irrationally and statistically crazy. Look at yields, look at gold, look at the dollar.\n\n# Extra points\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.bls.gov\\/news.release\\/empsit.t08.htm](https://preview.redd.it/2stidy4cwy3b1.png?width=1343&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=dab5e7f885a8195cfea00b63cef618cc54ab5d3d)\n\nFrom comment discussions:\n\n1. Self employed fell dramatically from 9.1M to 8.7M ie a reduction of 500K people.\n2. Part time for economic reasons decreased somewhat from 3.9M to 3.7M ie 200K.\n3. Part time for non-economic reasons rather increased.",
