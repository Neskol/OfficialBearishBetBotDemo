        "self-text": "Roku, a key player in the streaming industry, has shown promising performance in Q1 2023, with a noteworthy reduction in operating losses to $212.5 million. Moreover, in Q1 2023, Roku posted revenues of $740.99 million, a slight increase of 0.99% when compared to the same quarter in the previous year.\n\nIn terms of user growth, the company added 1.6 million active streaming accounts in Q1 2023, pushing the total active accounts to 71.6 million. Furthermore, Roku has forecasted a net revenue of $770 million for Q2 2023.\n\nIn the realm of market analysis, the consensus rating for Roku is \"Hold\". The mean price target for Roku's stock is $71.04, signifying an upside potential of 4.53%, with projections ranging from a high of $115 to a low of $41.\n\nConsidering these performance metrics and market expectations, we can develop a bullish thesis for Roku's next earnings call. This thesis is built around several key factors:\n\n**Growing Popularity and Subscriber Base**: Roku's Smart TV operating system is gaining popularity and the company added 1.6 million new active accounts in Q1 2023. This is a clear indicator that the company's user base is on the rise and reflects the growing demand for streaming services.\n\n**Improved Financial Performance**: Roku's ability to trim operating losses showcases the company's effective expense management. This is an indication that Roku is optimizing its operations and has a potential pathway to profitability.\n\n**Competitive Features**: Roku's offerings are impressive, providing a good balance of cost and performance. For instance, the 55r6a5r model supports all HDR formats, has a quantum dot layer for enhanced color performance, and runs on the Linux-based Roku OS.\n\n**Price Point and Color Accuracy**: Roku TVs offer a good balance between cost and performance. The QLED TVs provide a vibrant yet accurate color range, and they cover 96% of the Rec 709 color space and 80% of Rec 2020.\n\n**Brightness**: Roku's model 55r6a5r is capable of hitting 500 nits in peak brightness, which is a significant improvement over TVs in the same price range.\n\n**User Interface**: Roku's user interface is simple, easy to navigate, and doesn't bombard users with ads. This is one of its greatest strengths.\n\n**Potential for Market Expansion**: If Roku can successfully penetrate the higher price band, there's potential for them to move into the premium segment.\n\n**Positive Revenue Projection**: Roku's positive revenue forecast of $770 million for Q2 2023 indicates confidence in its business model and revenue generation capabilities.\n\n**Potential Upside in Stock Price**: The current consensus analyst rating for Roku is \"Hold\", but the high-end prediction for Roku's stock price is $115. This signals a significant upside potential.\n\nHowever, potential downsides include the limited number of zones in their 55r6a5r model leading to noticeable haloing or glowing around bright elements, the lack of support for 120Hz refresh rates and variable refresh rate features for gaming, and the requirement to create a Roku account to activate the TV.\n\nAn addendum that incorporates some extra key points:\n\n**Private Listening Features**: One of the unique selling points of Roku is its private listening feature available through their phone app and some of the remotes. This feature allows users to plug into their device for a personalized listening experience, proving especially useful for those living in shared spaces or households with different sleep schedules.\n\n**Roku OS on Affordable TVs**: Many sub-$500 TVs run on Roku OS, illustrating the popularity of Roku's software in the budget segment. This allows Roku to capture a significant segment of the market that seeks affordable smart TVs without compromising on the quality of the streaming experience.\n\n**Roku Stick and Boxes**: Consumers often pair Roku's external devices, such as sticks and boxes, with high-end TVs from manufacturers like Samsung, whose inbuilt Smart TV features may not meet user expectations or may deteriorate over time. Roku's standalone devices offer consistent performance and an intuitive user interface, which increases their appeal to users looking for a reliable streaming solution.\n\n**User-Friendly Interface**: Roku's easy-to-navigate interface with large buttons and voice-activated remote control is user-friendly, making it a popular choice among people of all ages, including older adults who may not be as tech-savvy. This ease of use and simplicity has been a major factor contributing to Roku's growth and reputation.\n\n**Regular Updates**: Unlike many manufacturers of budget TVs and set-top boxes, Roku is known for providing regular software updates. This commitment to maintaining a reliable, up-to-date user experience is another factor contributing to Roku's popularity.\n\n**Manufacturer Adoption**: From a manufacturer's perspective, adopting Roku's operating system is more convenient and cost-effective than developing, updating, and supporting their own software. This ease of integration has led to Roku OS being adopted in a wide range of devices, from budget to high-end TVs, further expanding Roku's market presence.\n\nIn summary, these factors enhance the value proposition of Roku's products and services, attracting a broad user base and fueling its growth in the competitive streaming market.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n**27 ROKU shares**\n\n**7 ROKU $69 7/28**\n\n**2 ROKU $80 9/15**\n\nall ROKU positions entered today\n\n**1 NFLX $475 7/21 (cheers on being the only streaming company that cuts leeches)**\n\nCredentials: actual Autism Spectrum Disorder with a hyper fixation on the stock market and using being insanely nerdy about shit to make hella bread.\n\nPast decent trades:\n\nLoaded NVDA shares before earnings because I\u2019m a college student and I study Brain & Cognitive Science, so I just talk about AI/ML/ANN all day.\n\nChegg Puts before earnings (20x+!!) because what a shitty company, Quora for idiots who can\u2019t cheat correctly. LLMs openly trained on stolen textbooks, insanely easy play. (I was preaching on the discord show call for this one).\n\nElf beauty calls before earnings\n\nORCL shares before earnings (IV was a bit yikes)\n\nI just keep the thesis private on my SSD usually but my friend wanted to see it so I didn\u2019t feel like texting him a word doc cause that\u2019s odd isn\u2019t it? Who knows, I\u2019ll just send him this link.",

        "title": "FedEx earnings today - What do?",
        "self-text": "Today, FedEx will be reporting Q4 earnings. The Air Freight/Couriers industry operates air transportation and recurring delivery services. This includes companies offering same-day deliveries, scheduled delivery and logistical services. The proliferation of e-commerce/online retail with a growing emphasis on faster delivery has expanded opportunities for this industry, and induced more competition. United Parcel Service, Inc., FedEx Corporation and Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. are some of the major companies in this industry. \n\nTheir fiscal year ends in May, which means the coming report covers the end of its fiscal year 2023. The company typically offers financial forecasts as a fiscal year begins, so FedEx\u2019s Tuesday report will offer investors an early look at what the logistics business indicates about how 2024 is shaping up for the global economy. \n\nAnalysts are estimating earnings of $4.85 per share as opposed to earnings of $6.87 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Wall Street is expecting the company to report $22.55 billion, a decrease of 7.60% over the prior year quarter. Looking at the full year, analysts are expecting a profit of $14.80 per share. In the previous year, there was a loss of $20.61 per share. On average, analysts estimate full-year revenue to be $90.88 billion, compared to $ 93.50 billion in the previous year.\n\nLast earnings was good though, in the last earnings report on February 28, FDX exceeded expectations by reporting earnings per share of $3.41. This surpassed the estimated figure of $2.76. This positive surprise highlights the company's ability to outperform market expectations and suggests its strong operational performance.\n\nI expect persistent demand weakness, especially at FedEx Express, to have dented performance in the to-be-reported quarter owing to lower global volumes. Increased purchased transportation rates and lower package volume are likely to have affected the quarterly performance of the FedEx Ground segment. A slowing economy has weighed on FedEx results in recent quarters.\n\nIn April, FedEx announced its [DRIVE initiative](https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/global-english/fedex-announces-planned-consolidation-of-operating-companies) to consolidate its FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Services and other operating companies into the single Federal Express Corporation under the FedEx brand. FedEx expects DRIVE to generate $4 billion in permanent cost reductions in 2025 after the transition is fully implemented in June 2024.\n\nAn Analyst from [Raymond James](https://www.raymondjames.ca/corporations-and-institutions/equity-capital-markets/equity-research/analyst-profiles) noted that the initiative will drive better margins, earnings and free cash flow in the coming years. The DRIVE transition, focus on trimming costs and capital allocation, along with a shareholder-friendly capital return program should improve returns, the firm wrote. They lowered its price target on FedEx stock to 280 from 285 but maintained the outperform rating on shares.\n\nMeanwhile, [Jefferies](https://www.jefferies.com/ResearchandAnalysis/Equity-Research/2/75) says \"all eyes will be on\" FedEx's fiscal 2024 guidance during results this afternoon. Wall Street could react negatively to an \"overly optimistic\" earnings target from the company, Jefferies wrote in a research note early Tuesday. An EPS guidance \"materially north of $20 would be viewed as a stretch-goal,\" the firm wrote while a \"realistic range\" would be between $15 to $21 per share. Jefferies maintained its 230 price target on FedEx stock and its hold rating on the shares.\n\nI believe a good report will launch the company up over 10% today, but it might not be in the cards. However, while my initial research was bearish but as I looked more into it, I started to believe in calls a bit more. But what does the technical analysis say? There are indications that the stock will move *both* up and down. Very indicative, right? On the bullish side, the MACD for FDX just turned positive on June 9th and we crossed above the 50-day moving average on June 16th. However, on the bearish side, the 10-day RSI Indicator for FDX moved out of overbought territory on June 16. The [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) demonstrated that the ticker has stayed in the overbought zone for 5 days. The longer the ticker stays in the overbought zone, the sooner a price pull-back is expected. In addition, FDX broke above its upper Bollinger Band on June 15th. This could be a sign that the stock is set to drop as the stock moves back below the upper band and toward the middle band. \n\nGuh. I'm going to get a strangle. I'm going to grab a FDX 6/23 240c for 4.55 and the 6/23 222.5p for 3.90. This means I can grab the strangle for $845. It'll be profitable if the stock goes down lower than ~214 (down about 8%) or up higher than ~248 (up about 7%). If it helps, FDX has moved - on average - more than 8% with earnings.",

Charles Schwab and Vanguard are on the list because they have a lot of shares in BlackRock. Top 10 companies who own shares of black rock.\n\nBecause of the pandemic and remote working. A lot of commercial buildings are vacant, empty, closing, and for lease in these commercial buildings are not collecting revenue and debts that they owe will be called in very soon and they can't pay those loans. So the commercial real estate will crash to about 40%. 2008 residential crash was 20%.",

        "self-text": "**TLDR: TGT is oversold and is due to return to $145 before Earnings and Low/Mid 160's after earnings. I'll probably do a DD on $TGT if/when I get my shit together. Questions/comments are appreciated and possibly used for DD insights.**\n\nFrom the creator of China-Doomer and shitty $SPY loss porn, I bring to media's currently most hated retailer: Target ($TGT). \n\nWe all know how the BS started and the resulting a FB post that \"rallied\" anti-woke consumers and scared $TGT investors. This bear parade has dropped around 30% from its peak. Multiple downgrades, many institutions hating on them. The recent short is at 11%, a highly bearish mentality over angry boomers. \n\n**So why am I bring them up now?**\n\nTarget is oversold on the agenda of \"decreasing consumer discretionary spending\" and \"protests\". These are nothing but an over-hyped bear's wet dream. For example, research is pointing towards a significant increase of foot traffic into Target. Consumer Spending is increasing despite the doomer posts.  \n\nThe downgrades reasoning seemed fishy that pointed at $WMT taking more of the sector. I would argue that $TGT target audiences are different from $WMT. $TGT's audience is Millennials/College Student who want a \"luxury\" experience that cannot afford it. These two audiences with large student debts may sound scary but will not hurt $TGT's bottom line as long as political garbage drags the issue.   \n\n**Conclusion**\n\n$TGT dropping as hard as they did while other discretionary consumer retailer/company is at/near 52w Highs seems contradictory. Either the entire market is ignoring $TGT (Consumer Spending is increasing) or the market is overpricing everyone else (Consumer Spending is decreasing yet they're expecting to buy $AAPL's $3.5k porn gear?). \n\n**Positions**\n\n\\- Currently debit spreads: 10x each Sept 145/155C & 155/165C\n\n\\- Goal: 50x Sept 145C & 155C and 200x 14DTE w/ +15% movement on earnings.",

        "title": "$UBS Deal of the Decade (DD)",
        "self-text": "Here\u2019s a bold prediction: $UBS stock is set to take off thanks to the Credit Suisse acquisition deal.\n\n**But credit suisse sucked, right?**\nYes credit suisse sucked. They had incapable management, ran from scandal to scandal and did with Archegos and Greensill some of the worst investments in recent years. This resulted in Credit Suisse losing money over the last two years. \nBut unlike Silicon Valley Bank which made some mad bet on interest rates and was essentially bankrupt, Credit Suisse still had a solid balance sheet and a valuable core business franchise.\nThe general view is that UBS was forced into the acquisition with no other player being interested at all. That wasn\u2019t the case though. As revealed later on by Swiss media, Blackrock was interested as a potential bidder for CS. (1) In 2009 they acquired Barclays\u2019s investment arm in 2009 for $15.2 billion which made it into the world\u2019s biggest asset manager. The Swiss government wanted a local solution though. And so it came that **UBS was \u201cforced\u201d to dictate deal terms that Credit Suisse and the Swiss government couldn\u2019t refuse.**\n\n**Here the main deal facts (2):**\n- Ubs paid $3.5 bln to acquire Credit Suisse with net tangible assets of $48.8 bln \n- Loss protection guarantee of $10 bln by the Swiss government for UBS for any loss above $5.5bln arising from potentially problematic assets that UBS takes over from the CS acquisition.\n- $110 billion in liquidity assistance to UBS by the Swiss National Bank\n- Credit Suisse AT 1 obligations of 16 billion francs ($17.2 billion) were written down completely as part of transaction.\n\n**UBS is set for a one-time gain of 5 times its yearly net profits:**\nUBS paid $3.5 bln to acquire $48.8 bln of Credit Suisse net tangible assets. Per their SEC filing UBS is set to declare an additional one-time gain of 34.8 bln USD in their second (upcoming) quarter. (3) **This with $10.6 bln of Credit Suisse assets already written down as value corrections by UBS.** Keep in mind that this is likely a *conservative estimate by UBS as it\u2019s in their interest to overstate the risks of Credit Suisse takeover not to worsen Swiss politics sentiment* about the deal and to build up the narrative of a new CEO who starts with a difficult situation and then turns it into a great success.\n\n**Long-term synergies with a restructuring process guaranteed by Swiss government:**\nUBS acquired a lot of assets for an extremely low price. But in order to profit off this acquisition, UBS has to succeed in the restructuring process Credit Suisse failed for so long. This will likely not be without initial losses. Keep in mind though that significant losses will be covered by the Swiss government with the loss guarantee of $10 bln. \nWhile UBS will drive down the risky investment banking of Credit Suisse their wealth management divisions complement each other well where Credit Suisse had traditionally a strong presence in SEA and Latin America where UBS was weak. The fusion of Credit Suisse and UBS will lead to significant cost savings from the resulting synergies. While integration is usually not easy for banks, UBS and Credit Suisse literally have their Headquarters on the same street facing each other. \nUBS also acquired the pearl of Credit Suisse, it\u2019s Swiss division that alone consistently makes more than $1bln annual net profit which UBS could either IPO for an estimated $15bln (already five times more than the total acquisition of CS) or keep for an even stronger position in Switzerland. (4)\n\n**Unbiased Experts see it as great deal:**\nIn a survey of Swiss economists (unbiased) approximately three quarters of the surveyed economic researchers view the takeover as a great deal for UBS. (5) \n\n**Management is competent:**\nWhereas Credit Suisse management was infamous for its incompetency, the new UBS will be led by no other than the former UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti who in the past already successfully winded down the investment bank of UBS and turned it into the successful bank it is today. A task he now has to repeat for the integrated Credit Suisse.\n\n**Bank is secured by Swiss National Bank:**\nUBS was provided by the Swiss National Bank $108 bln of liquidity needed to weather any potential future bank crisis. It\u2019s way too big to fail for Switzerland now so it\u2019s one of the most secure banks in the world.\n\n**Credit Suisse outflows already stopped:**\nCredit Suisse was suffering from the outflows of their customers due to uncertainty. With the acquisition of UBS these outflows have already stopped completely. (6)\n\n**Deal is priced in as a negative for UBS:**\nThe current UBS stock price at $20.40 is lower than before the acquisition. \n\n**Tldr:**\nUBS is set to make a one-time gain of 34.8 bln USD (5 times their net profit of 2022) in upcoming quarter. Long-term UBS will profit from synergies while the Swiss government guaranteeing any potential significant losses from the restructuring process. Management is competent. The market weirdly thinks the acquisition of Credit Suisse was a net negative for UBS as the current stock price of UBS is lower than before the acquisition. \n\n\nThis is no financial advice. As usual do your own research.\n\n\n**Sources:**\n(1) https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/how-the-swiss--trinity--forced-ubs-to-save-credit-suisse/48378088\n\n(2) https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/bloomberg/ubs-to-buy-credit-suisse-in--3.3-billion-deal-to-end-crisis/48373632\n\n(3) https://www.reuters.com/article/brief-ubs-estimates-348-bln-of-negative-idUSFWN37D21I\n\n(4) https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/de/research-berichte/finanzberichte-tochtergesellschaften/credit-suisse-schweiz-ag.html\n\n(5) https://kof.ethz.ch/news-und-veranstaltungen/medien/medienmitteilungen/2023/03/kof-nzz-umfrage-unter-oekonominnen-und-oekonomen-wirtschaftsforschende-bewerten-die-uebernahme-der-credit-suisse-durch-die-ubs-skeptisch.html\n\n(6) https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/ubs-ceo-ermotti-credit-suisse-no-longer-seeing-outflows-situation-has-stabilised-2023-05-12/\n\n(7) https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/credit-suisse-ceo-memo-signals-ubs-deal-close-monday-bloomberg-2023-06-10/",

I'm pretty sure that rate hikes will be more effective for the environment than say buying an EV, which by the way even though they're electric they still need to mow down rainforests for metals. Honestly, if you're hoping for rate cuts just so that your $1200 in SPY calls print, you're almost like a climate denier at this point. You should be hoping for rate increases instead so that we can save the environment.\n\nAnd not only from an environmental standpoint, but I mean, who wouldn't love a high risk-free rate? Imagine treasuries were yielding 10%, I mean at that point I'm guessing tons of people would just be holding debt securities and we wouldn't need to all be piling into only 7 different stonks (i.e the Fangs) like we are now",

        "self-text": " \n\n**plays at the bottom**\n\n**DHC** / **The RMR Group** (majority stake holder) is currently trying to fuck over the average investor (but lets be real ya'll don't care about that) however because they were challenged by now 2 hedge funds there's suddenly two ways to play this; the smart way and the fuck it we ball way (my position; I'm here to gamble). As of now what we know is RMR controls both sides of the trade however two hedge funds (who control 14.8% of the company combined) are contesting and a 13D has been filed to see who owns what. basically when we get more info the stock is going to jump in whichever direction is winning.\n\nEssentially **RMR group owns both companies that they decided will do a merger.** the problem isn't however the merger but what the merger is trading for. atm DHC is worth very little in stock value however their underlying assets are well above what the average investor valued it for. basically it was being valued at 1/5th of what you would get if they claimed bankruptcy. essentially if DHC claimed bankruptcy you would 5x your money. that's how undervalued they were. however to get around trying to pay out investors while moving assets RMR group decided to use the current stock price to give all the assets the merged group which has a still undervalued stock price however not the same and in a completely different industry. basically. **RMR group was going to force you sell your stock for less then most would say its worth.** however **two hedge fund are currently contesting it FFL and DE SHAW,** and using the 13D filing to get a better understanding of the situation inside the company. who owns how much stock and in what way etc. etc. it gets a little more complicated as we get more info but that doesn't really matter in terms of you making money. all you need to know is how this helps you\n\nTLDR the plays:\n\n**the \"guaranteed\" play:** Bet on IV as more information gets released this little company which saw little to know news will see big increases in IV. **essentially the play is to get a strangle dated aug** 18th or Sep 15th and abuse the unusual movement in what's normally a dividend play. basically you should be able to ride the news train for the next few months and jump off when the news gets interesting in either direction.\n\n**the balls to the wall play: get the 5$ or 7.5$ call with a later expiration date.** Basically your betting that when the 13D filing comes back with news. there is enough outside investment (both hedge funs and retail investors) that they can bully the RMR Group (the guys that currently own both sides of the merger) their is also a third outcome where one of the sides starts buying up the shares to make sure the other side cant contest (a classic hostile takeover) in which you would also win. the issue with this one is that its entirely possible that the RMR group or affiliated insiders have too much leverage to the point where no one can contest them. nonetheless this is a better gamble the most random shots in the dark on this sub so don't complain to me if it dosnt pan out\n\nas we all know, **no one knows if the stock will go up down sideways or in fucking circles** but we her at wall street bets use all 1 of our braincells to make money or lose it all trying. **here's your gamble of the day good luck.**\n\n**My postion:**\n\n**DHC 5$ Call 12/15 100 buys**",

        "self-text": "The airlines continue to get no respect, led by Delta Air Lines ($DAL). Anyone just needs to look at the recent rally in the cruise line sector to see how the stock market is irrationally negative on the airlines. The investment thesis remains ultra Bullish on airline stocks like Delta.\n\nFor the last year, the market has told investors to not buy airline stocks due to an impending recession. Airlines like Delta have made tons of money and returned to cash flow positive, yet the stock hasn't rallied from the early 2021 levels when signs existed that travel demand would rebound from the covid destruction.\n\nThe amazing part here is that the cruise lines were about a year behind the airlines in removing covid restrictions and returning to profits and positive cash flows. Most airlines reported strong profits starting in Q2'22, though Delta reported small profits at the end of 2021.\n\nCruise lines like Carnival Corp. ($CCL) and Royal Caribbean ($RCL) were still reporting large losses in the last couple of quarters. In fact, the forecast is for Carnival to report another large loss for the just ended May quarter due to the inclusion of March in the quarterly results.\n\nIn essence, the airlines are far ahead of the cruise lines in the travel recovery, but oddly the stocks have underperformed. For the YTD period, Royal Caribbean and Carnival have seen share price gains of ~93% versus the solid, but much smaller, 28% gain for Delta.\n\nThe amazing part is that Delta has forecast a return to near record EPS in 2024. The airline is forecasting an EPS of up $6 this year for a stock trading at only $42 now.\n\nWhile Royal Caribbean has a goal of hitting a record EPS in 2025, the cruise line is only now starting to generate profits. Carnival has no such plan to return to record profits anytime soon, but the stock has rallied anyway.\n\nA prime example of the disconnect here are the forward PE ratios. Delta trades at only 6x PE targets while Royal Caribbean is now up at 14x and Carnival trades at a market multiple of 19x.\n\nThe share price move is strange considering Delta is in a better financial position, having returned to positive cash flows sooner. Logic would say the casino is missing an obvious big play in $DAL.\n\nCheck The Balance Sheet\nA big key to the forecasts of Delta is the return to large positive cash flows. Previously, the airline returned billions in capital to shareholders annually via mainly stock buybacks and now these cash flows will repay debt.\n\nDelta ended Q1 with net debt of $15.4 billion, but the company still has debt far above pre-covid levels. The airline forecasts a combination of lower capex and higher income, leading to over $6 billion in positive cash flows through the end of 2024 to drive net debt far lower.\n\nThe airline should end 2024 with net debt back towards the early 2020 levels. Delta Air Lines should generate $4+ billion in annual free cash flows starting in 2024, leaving the airline with the options of either pushing towards positive cash balances or starting to repurchase extremely cheap shares here.\n\nOne of the biggest aspects missed by the business return to normalization is that the loyalty plan offers a huge revenue boost over 2019 levels. Delta works with American Express ($AXP) on Delta Skymiles and the remuneration from the plan has grown from $4 billion in 2019 to a goal of $7+ billion in 2024.\n\nThese high margin revenues provide a huge upside to the potential profits versus the $7.33 earned back in 2019. As the interest expenses are cut back to pre-covid levels or lower, investors should start looking at the potential for Delta to earn $8 to $9 per share in 2025 and beyond.\n\nTakeaway\nThe key investor takeaway is that Delta remains cheap. The stock should trade at an equivalent, or higher, forward PE multiple than the cruise lines. The airline remains on a solid path to hitting the $7+ EPS target in 2024 and the stock should ultimately follow the debt repayments Delta will undertake in the next year to much higher prices.\n\nFalling energy prices and the AMEX remunerations are additional catalysts for faster profits and cash flow.",

It's not all roses and rainbows - there are some potential pitfalls to look out for, what are some good stocks to target?\n\n \n\n1. **Loan Demand**: Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. As a result, the demand for loans, particularly for things like mortgages or business expansion, could decrease. This could limit the growth of the bank's lending portfolio.\n2. **Increased Default Risk**: With the higher cost of borrowing, the risk of default could potentially increase, which could impact the bank's credit risk.\n3. **Market Volatility**: The stock market reaction to rate hikes can be negative, as higher interest rates can make bonds more attractive relative to stocks, leading to volatility in the financial markets. This can affect banks that have significant holdings in market-based securities or depend on a robust stock market for their wealth management businesses.",

        "self-text": "Here's the summary of Shell's recent narrative:\n\n>Oil giant Shell is doubling down on its focus on fossil fuel profits and attracting investors by announcing plans to increase shareholder payouts and reduce capital investment. The company aims to deliver a 15% dividend increase and stock buybacks of at least $5 billion in the second half of 2023. While expanding its liquefied natural gas business, Shell will also invest in \"low carbon\" technologies such as biofuels, hydrogen, electric vehicle charging, and carbon capture and storage. Notably absent from the announcement were any mentions of renewable energy sources like wind and solar.\n\n>Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, emphasized the company's commitment to providing secure energy while transforming to thrive in a low-carbon future. The goal is to create profitable business models that can be rapidly scaled to impact global energy system decarbonization. However, Shell's decision to prioritize fossil fuel investments has faced criticism from investors like the Church of England's pension funds and climate groups who accuse the company of neglecting renewable energy opportunities.\n\n>The International Energy Agency predicts that global demand for oil used in energy will peak in five years. While Shell claims to have met its target to cut oil production ahead of schedule, it continues to face scrutiny regarding its overall production reduction goals. Despite the company's efforts, critics argue that Shell and its competitors are prioritizing profits from oil and gas operations instead of transitioning to renewable energy sources.",

The market's reaction to Nasdaq's largest-ever acquisition sent shockwaves through the industry, causing widespread selling pressure and rattling investor confidence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The substantial decline resulted in NDAQ shares opening significantly lower, trading just above their year-to-date lows of approximately $52, a level reminiscent of the mid-March slump. Despite a modest recovery of 10% over the past three months from those lows, Nasdaq's stock encountered formidable resistance at its 160-day moving average, preventing any sustained upward momentum.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Despite the downward pressure, short-term options traders have demonstrated a prevailing call-bias, as indicated by NDAQ's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.46. This ratio, lower than 95% of readings from the past year, suggests that traders hold bullish expectations, anticipating a possible recovery in the stock's price in the near future.  \n>  \n>The market's reaction to Nasdaq's sharp decline has led to a compelling situation for options traders. Options on NDAQ are currently priced relatively affordably, with NDAQ's Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) reading at 19%, placing it in the very low 3rd percentile compared to readings from the past 12 months. This low SVI implies that options traders are factoring in lower-than-expected levels of volatility, indicating a perceived stability in the stock's future performance.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "self-text": "&#x200B;\n\n[DCF Estimate - Smiply Wallstreet](https://preview.redd.it/krozepf2le5b1.png?width=853&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6e5b2bc2b1dfbcb34a8889f879b72a20a19f0e6e)\n\n In an in-depth financial analysis, Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) is suggested to be 49% undervalued based on its intrinsic value calculated using a 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity (DCF) model. The projected fair value is set at US$29.65, significantly higher than the current share price of US$15.02 and the analyst price target of US$9.54. The DCF model estimates future cash flows and discounts them to present value. Key assumptions of this model include an estimated 8.1% discount rate and future cash flows based on a combination of analyst estimates and extrapolations from previous free cash flow. The valuation, which accounts for 10 years of cash flows and a terminal value, sums to a total equity value of US$63b.  \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-palantir-technologies-inc-125453923.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-palantir-technologies-inc-125453923.html)",

        "self-text": "Some of you may have seen my [DD post on Chart Industries (GTLS) in relation to an upcoming EPA rule change limiting PFAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13m1a6f/dd_new_epa_pfas_regulations_big_money_for_chart/) contamination in water. [But as I briefly mentioned, Chart Industries also has significant potential to increase its sales in relation to potential new EPA carbon emissions regulations in the natural gas industry.](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/2023/05/11/epa-takes-aim-a-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-coal-gas-powerplants-alliant-midamerican/70209486007/) Chart Industries is a major equipment supplier in the natural gas industry and has moved to significantly diversify its business lines to include water treatment and, importantly for this post, carbon capture technology. If the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations are adopted, carbon capture technology will be a key element in natural gas plants being able to meet the new emissions standards. Chart Industries is well poised to profit off of any such regulation change.\n\n[In 2021, Chart won a subsidies from the Department of Energy to develop carbon capture technologies](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/10/07/2310264/9318/en/Chart-Industries-Inc-SES-Cryogenic-Carbon-Capture-Technology-Selected-for-Funding-from-the-U-S-Department-of-Energy.html). Most carbon capture technology developed thus far has focused on \"sequestration\", which attempts to lock the carbon underground to prevent its emission into the atmosphere. [However, Chart's technology takes a different approach which is more energy efficient and actually produces a useable end product.  Natural gas power plants use a \"flue\" to disperse unwanted post-combustion gasses after the natural gas is burned to produce power. Chart's technology intercepts the \"flue gases\" before they are released into the atmosphere and liquifies them, thus creating liquid carbon-dioxide and other liquid forms of greenhouse gas.](https://www.chartindustries.com/Products/Carbon-Capture) These liquid gases can then be resold on the open market. As a result, Chart is well poised to profit off of the newly proposed EPA carbon emission regulations as virtually all natural gas power plants will be forced to implement some type of carbon capture technology in order to meet the new standards.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Diagram of Chart Industries carbon capture process](https://preview.redd.it/yfq2z4zfxs4b1.png?width=1167&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5318cfc476dec8b1e0d7041fbb6f2056cbd46b8a)\n\n[While many naysayers may argue that \"renewables are the future and natural gas is the past\", they ignore that natural gas is currently the largest source of American energy at 36% of total American energy production in the United States.](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/us-energy-facts/data-and-statistics.php) This figure has been rising over the past several years, despite the push for \"green energy\". [Furthermore, there has in the past several months been a lashback by both leftwing environmental groups and conservatives against offshore wind energy, which i will expound upon in the future](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/01/29/whale-deaths-new-jersey-offshore-wind-00079462). The totality of the circumstances shows that natural gas power is not going away anytime soon, and that Chart Industries is well situated to profit off it.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pyfa45ljxs4b1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=402cafe5a1c346ff672805244e7ebfae73afb9c7\n\nI am long both GLTS with 141 shares of GLTS and 3 June 16 $120 strike calls  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bm2wj1vixs4b1.jpg?width=970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=d4292f0efd6b3fb34a87022cb9b437c27ddabae8",

Today's bearishness is supposedly caused by a fear that JPOW will raise rates next week following Australia and Canada. But this is counterintuitive because one of the major issues of the bank turmoil recently is the huge unrealized losses on HTM securities and loan portfolios. Moreover, a rate increase would also hit small caps the hardest by causing even tighter lending environments. So why would anyone be buying into banks right now? The only thing I can think of is that big fish are dumping tech to make retails sell off their shares and move it to the seemingly well performing banking sector just so they can dump their bank holdings and buy up the marked down tech stocks again.

It\u2019s not only my largest, but I\u2019ve discovered when I give it a good shake it can predict earnings. \n\nMy shaken eighth has determined NIO is a massive POS. They\u2019ve missed every sales target badly for four consecutive quarters. The CEO is an actual circus clown talking about nuclear fusion investments during this past week. NIO seemingly does everything except sell cars. \n\nThe Chinese consumer prefers LI Auto, BYD and Tesla. Nio is becoming a running joke in Chy-na. Worse yet, guidance is going to be SIGNIFICANTLY lowered. NIO is currently on pace to reach only 31% of its 2023 sales projections. 31% LOL. There is no way NIO can credibly not lower guidance in its upcoming earnings call. It\u2019s no longer a growth company. It\u2019s margins are already so thin, and so it can\u2019t afford to cut the prices of its models to compete with Tesla, BYD and LI Auto. Nio is seen as an \u201caverage\u201d EV by Chinese consumers at a \u201cluxury\u201d price. AKA nobody wants them. Especially in the EU. Their expansion was a MASSIVE fail.\n\nNio is going to get clapped on Friday. Honestly, probably -30% which will bring it to a more appropriate (yet still overvalued) valuation of ~$9B. My ball says $5.35-$5.50 after earnings.\n\nTLDR: NIO burns cash like crazy in a high interest rate environment, consistently misses sales projections by enormous amounts and their CEO is a carnie who thinks his nearly bankrupt EV company should be investing in nuclear fusion. NIO won\u2019t be around within 18-24 months.",
